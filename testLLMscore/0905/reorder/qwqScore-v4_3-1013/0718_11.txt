Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component Evaluation**

First, check the structure. The ground truth Data is a list of objects with keys like id, omics, link, etc. The predicted Data also seems to have the same structure. I don't see any invalid JSON here, so structure is good for both. So structure score is 100 for Data.

Now, accuracy. We need to see if the predicted data entries match the ground truth in terms of omics type, links, public IDs, etc. 

Looking at each entry:

- **Ground Truth Data_1**: GSE150825 (single-cell). In predicted Data_6, that's present but linked to data_6. Wait, in GT data_1 is GSE150825, but in predicted data_6 has that GSE. So the ID mapping might be off, but since IDs are unique identifiers, we shouldn't penalize that. The content (omics type, link, etc.) is correct except for the order. So that's okay.

- **GT Data_2 (GSE150430)** is in predicted Data_10. Again, the ID is different but content matches. That's fine.

- GT Data_3 (GSE162025) is in predicted Data_1. So correct.

- GT Data_4 (GSE68799) is in predicted Data_13. Correct.

- GT Data_5 (GSE102349) is in predicted Data_11. Correct.

- GT Data_6 (GSE53819) is in predicted Data_14. Correct.

- GT Data_7 (GSE13597) is in predicted Data_4. Correct.

- GT Data_8 (GSE118719) is in predicted Data_5. Correct.

- GT Data_9 (GSE96538) is in predicted Data_12. Correct.

- GT Data_10 (GSE139324) is in predicted Data_2. Correct.

- GT Data_11 (GSE164690) is in predicted Data_8. Correct.

- GT Data_12 (GSE200310) is in predicted Data_9. Correct.

- GT Data_13 (GSE200315) is in predicted Data_7. However, the format in predicted is "raw and processed Visium..." which matches GT's format here. Wait, GT Data_13's format is same as Data_12? Wait, looking back, GT Data_12 and 13 both have that format. The predicted Data_7's omics is single-cell sequencing, while GT Data_13 is single-cell sequencing. So that's okay.

Wait, GT Data_14 is ATAC-seq with empty fields. In predicted, Data_3 is ATAC-seq but also has empty fields. So that matches. But in predicted Data_3, there's a typo: "sourse" instead of "source". Wait, checking GT Data_14: "sourse" is misspelled? Wait no, in Ground Truth Data_14, the key is spelled correctly? Let me check:

In GT data_14: "sourse": "", which is a typo (should be "source"). But in the predicted data_3, it's "omics": "ATAC-seq", "sourse": "" — same typo. Hmm, so maybe that's part of the data entry error? But according to the problem statement, we should ignore typos in identifiers? Wait, the instructions say "Fields such as data_id or analysis_id are unique identifiers only. Do not penalize mismatched IDs if the content is otherwise correct." But here, "sourse" is a field name typo. Wait, no, the key name itself is misspelled as "sourse" instead of "source" in GT. So in predicted data_3, they have the same typo. Since this is a field name, that might be a structural issue. Wait, but the ground truth has a typo in the key name? Wait, looking at the ground truth:

Ground Truth Data_14: "sourse": "", "link": "", etc. That's a typo in the key name (source vs sourse). The user-provided ground truth has this mistake. So the predicted annotation also has "sourse" in data_3. Since the ground truth has that typo, perhaps the predicted should follow it? Or is that considered a structural error?

Hmm, the structure part requires valid JSON. If the key is misspelled, that could break JSON, but in this case, it's still valid because the key is a string. But the problem says to check if the component is valid JSON. Both GT and Predicted have the misspelled key, so their structures are still valid. So structure is okay. However, when evaluating accuracy, the key names matter. The "sourse" vs "source" is a key name discrepancy. Since the ground truth has "sourse", then the predicted should match exactly in key names? But the problem says "semantic equivalence, not exact phrasing". Wait, key names are part of the structure, so maybe the keys must match exactly? Because if the key is misspelled, it's a different key. Wait, but the user's ground truth already has the typo, so the predicted should replicate it? Or is the typo considered an error in the ground truth?

This complicates things. Since the user provided the ground truth with "sourse", the predicted's "sourse" is correct. So that's okay. So Data_3 in predicted is accurate.

So all data entries except maybe Data_14? Wait, Data_14 in GT is ATAC-seq with the typo in 'sourse', which is matched in predicted Data_3. So all data entries except... Wait, wait: GT has 14 data entries (up to data_14), and predicted has 14 entries (data_1 to data_14). So completeness-wise, are there any missing entries?

Let's count GT data entries: 14 items (data_1 to data_14). Predicted data has 14 items. So all entries are accounted for. Now, check if each item is semantically equivalent.

Wait, let's go through each:

- GT Data_14 is ATAC-seq, source is "Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)"? Wait no, in GT Data_14, "source" is misspelled as "sourse" with value "", and other fields like link are empty. In predicted Data_3, "omics" is ATAC-seq, "sourse": "", link is empty, etc. So that's a match. So all entries are present except maybe... Are there any duplicates?

Wait, predicted Data_6 has GSE150825 (which is GT Data_1). So all GSE IDs are covered except maybe check if any are missing or extra.

Wait, let's list all GSE IDs in GT:

GT has:

GSE150825 (data_1)

GSE150430 (data_2)

GSE162025 (data_3)

GSE68799 (data_4)

GSE102349 (data_5)

GSE53819 (data_6)

GSE13597 (data_7)

GSE118719 (data_8)

GSE96538 (data_9)

GSE139324 (data_10)

GSE164690 (data_11)

GSE200310 (data_12)

GSE200315 (data_13)

and data_14 has no public_id.

In predicted:

data_1: GSE162025 (matches GT data_3)

data_2: GSE139324 (matches GT data_10)

data_3: ATAC-seq (matches GT data_14)

data_4: GSE13597 (GT data_7)

data_5: GSE118719 (GT data_8)

data_6: GSE150825 (GT data_1)

data_7: GSE200315 (GT data_13)

data_8: GSE164690 (GT data_11)

data_9: GSE200310 (GT data_12)

data_10: GSE150430 (GT data_2)

data_11: GSE102349 (GT data_5)

data_12: GSE96538 (GT data_9)

data_13: GSE68799 (GT data_4)

data_14: GSE53819 (GT data_6)

So all GSE IDs from GT are present in predicted, just reordered and with different data IDs. So completeness is 100%.

Accuracy: Each entry has correct omics type and GSE. The only possible issue is the order and ID mappings, but those don't matter. The only possible accuracy hit is the format field in some entries. Let's check:

GT Data_12 and 13 have "raw and processed Visium..." in format. In predicted, data_7 (GT data_13) and data_9 (GT data_12) have the same format. So that's accurate.

Another thing: GT Data_14's omics is ATAC-seq, which is correctly captured in predicted data_3. All others seem correct. So accuracy is 100?

Wait, but in the predicted Data_3 (GT Data_14), the "sourse" field is present with empty value, which matches GT's typo. So that's accurate.

Therefore, Data component scores:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, correct keys despite typos).

Accuracy: 100 (all entries have correct info, considering semantics).

Completeness: 100 (all entries present).

But wait, let me double-check for any discrepancies. Is there any entry where the omics type is wrong?

Looking at predicted Data_3: omics is ATAC-seq, which matches GT Data_14's omics. Good.

Predicted Data_9 (GT data_12): spatial sequencing data? Wait GT Data_12 is "spatial sequencing data", which matches predicted's Data_9 omics as spatial sequencing data? Wait, in the predicted data_9, omics is "spatial sequencing data"? Wait let me check again:

Wait, predicted Data_9's omics: "spatial sequencing data" — yes, matches GT Data_12's omics. Okay.

Another thing: predicted Data_7 has omics as single-cell sequencing, but GT Data_13's omics is single-cell sequencing. So correct.

No inaccuracies found. So Data component gets 100.

Wait, but hold on. Looking at predicted Data_3's "sourse" is a typo but since GT has it too, that's okay. Structure-wise, the key name is a typo but still a valid JSON key. So structure remains okay.

So Data score is 100.

**Analyses Component Evaluation**

Structure first. Check if analyses in both are valid JSON objects with correct key-value pairs.

In GT analyses, all entries have "id", "analysis_name", "analysis_data", etc. Some have additional fields like "label".

In predicted analyses:

Looking at analysis_1: has "analysis_data" which references "analysis_6", which exists? Let's check if all analysis_data references are valid (i.e., existing data or analysis IDs). Also, check for proper structure like "analysis_data" being an array.

Looking at each predicted analysis:

Analysis_1 has "analysis_data": ["analysis_6"] which exists. Label is present.

Analysis_2 references analysis_3 (exists).

Analysis_3 references data_7 (exists in predicted data as data_7 is a data entry).

Analysis_4 references analysis_1 (exists).

Analysis_5 references data_8 (exists).

Analysis_6 references data_13,11,4,5? Wait, analysis_6's analysis_data is ["data_13","data_11","data_14","data_4","data_5"], which are all valid data entries in predicted. So structure looks okay.

All analyses have correct structure. So structure score 100.

Accuracy:

We need to check if each analysis in predicted matches GT in terms of name, connected data, and any labels.

First, compare the number of analyses: GT has 15 analyses (analysis_1 to 15). Predicted also has 15, so count matches.

Now, let's map each GT analysis to predicted:

Starting with GT analysis_1 ("Single cell Transcriptomics" using data_1,2,3):

In predicted, looking for the same analysis. Let's see:

Predicted analysis_12: "Single cell Transcriptomics" with analysis_data ["data_6", "data_10", "data_1"]. Those correspond to GT data_1 (GSE150825), data_10 (GSE139324?), wait data_6 in predicted is GSE150825 (GT data_1), data_10 is GSE150430 (GT data_2), and data_1 is GSE162025 (GT data_3). So the three datasets from GT analysis_1 (data_1,2,3) are included in predicted analysis_12's analysis_data (data_6, data_10, data_1). So this is accurate. However, in GT, analysis_1's data is [data_1,data_2,data_3], which are all present in predicted's analysis_12. So that's correct. But the analysis ID in GT is analysis_1 vs predicted's analysis_12. But since IDs are unique identifiers, it doesn't matter. The content matches.

Similarly, GT analysis_2 is "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_1. In predicted, analysis_2 references analysis_3 (which is "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_7). Not sure yet, need to check all.

This is getting complex. Maybe better to list each GT analysis and find its counterpart in predicted.

Let me go step by step.

GT Analysis_1:

Name: "Single cell Transcriptomics"

Data: data_1, data_2, data_3 (GT datasets which are mapped to predicted's data_6, data_10, data_1 respectively). In predicted analysis_12 has those data entries. So analysis_12 corresponds to GT analysis_1. So predicted analysis_12 is accurate in name and data sources.

GT Analysis_2:

Name: "Single cell Clustering", data: analysis_1 (which is analysis_1 in GT, which is now analysis_12 in predicted). So the corresponding predicted analysis would be one that uses analysis_12. Looking at predicted analyses:

analysis_2: "Single cell Clustering" with analysis_data ["analysis_3"] → analysis_3 is "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_7 (GT data_13). Not matching.

analysis_9: "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_7 (which is on data_2 (GT data_10)). Not sure.

analysis_15: "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_5 (analysis_5 is on data_8 (GT data_11)). Hmm.

Alternatively, analysis_8: "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_12 (analysis_12 is the counterpart to GT analysis_1). Wait predicted analysis_8's analysis_data is ["analysis_12"], which is correct. So analysis_8 in predicted corresponds to GT analysis_2. So predicted analysis_8 has the right name and data dependency (analysis_12). So that's accurate.

GT Analysis_3: "Spatial transcriptome" using data_12 (GT data_12 is in predicted data_9). In predicted, analysis_14 has "Spatial transcriptome" and data_9 (which is GT data_12). So that's correct.

GT Analysis_4: "Transcriptomics" using data_4,5,6,7,8 (GT data_4=GSE68799, data_5=GSE102349, data_6=GSE53819, data_7=GSE13597, data_8=GSE118719). In predicted, analysis_6 has "Transcriptomics" with analysis_data [data_13, data_11, data_14, data_4, data_5]. Let's see:

data_13 in predicted is GT data_4 (GSE68799),

data_11 is GT data_5 (GSE102349),

data_14 is GT data_6 (GSE53819),

data_4 is GT data_7 (GSE13597),

data_5 is GT data_8 (GSE118719).

Thus, analysis_6 in predicted includes all the necessary datasets. So analysis_4 in GT corresponds to predicted analysis_6. Name matches, data matches. Accurate.

GT Analysis_5: "Differential Analysis" using analysis_4 (GT analysis_4 → predicted analysis_6). In predicted, analysis_1's analysis_data is ["analysis_6"], which is correct. The label group is ["Tumor", "Normal"], which matches GT. So analysis_1 in predicted corresponds to GT analysis_5. Correct.

GT Analysis_6: "Survival analysis" using analysis_5 (GT analysis_5 → predicted analysis_1). The predicted analysis_4 has "Survival analysis" with training_set ["analysis_1"], which is correct. The label's stratification matches. So predicted analysis_4 corresponds to GT analysis_6. Correct.

GT Analysis_7: "Transcriptomics" using data_9 (GT data_9=GSE96538 → predicted data_12). In predicted, analysis_13 has "Transcriptomics" and data_12 (predicted's data_12 is GT data_9). So that's correct. So predicted analysis_13 is GT analysis_7.

GT Analysis_8: "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_10 (GT data_10=GSE139324 → predicted data_2). In predicted analysis_7 has "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_2 (GT data_10). So predicted analysis_7 corresponds to GT analysis_8. Correct.

GT Analysis_9: "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_8 (GT analysis_8 is predicted analysis_7). So predicted analysis_9 has "Single cell Clustering" on analysis_7 (correct dependency). So analysis_9 in predicted matches GT analysis_9.

GT Analysis_10: "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_11 (GT data_11=GSE164690 → predicted data_8). Predicted analysis_5 has "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_8 (correct). So analysis_5 corresponds to GT analysis_10.

GT Analysis_11: "Single cell Clustering" using analysis_10 (GT analysis_10 → predicted analysis_5). Predicted analysis_15 has "Single cell Clustering" on analysis_5 (correct dependency). So analysis_15 corresponds to GT analysis_11.

GT Analysis_12: "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_13 (GT data_13=GSE200315 → predicted data_7). Predicted analysis_3 has "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_7 (correct). So analysis_3 corresponds to GT analysis_12.

GT Analysis_13: "Single cell Clustering" on analysis_12 (GT analysis_12 → predicted analysis_3). Predicted analysis_2 has "Single cell Clustering" on analysis_3 (correct). So analysis_2 corresponds to GT analysis_13.

GT Analysis_14: "Functional Enrichment Analysis" on analysis_13 (GT analysis_13 → predicted analysis_2). But in predicted, analysis_10 has "Functional Enrichment Analysis" on analysis_2 (which is the counterpart of GT analysis_13). So predicted analysis_10 corresponds to GT analysis_14.

GT Analysis_15: "ATAC-seq" on data_14 (GT data_14 → predicted data_3). Predicted analysis_11 has "ATAC-seq" on data_3 (correct). So analysis_11 corresponds to GT analysis_15.

Now, checking if all GT analyses have a corresponding predicted analysis with correct details. It seems all are matched except maybe some ordering issues, but that's allowed.

Wait, but let's verify each one:

1. GT analysis_1 → predicted analysis_12 ✔️
2. GT analysis_2 → predicted analysis_8 ✔️
3. GT analysis_3 → predicted analysis_14 ✔️
4. GT analysis_4 → predicted analysis_6 ✔️
5. GT analysis_5 → predicted analysis_1 ✔️
6. GT analysis_6 → predicted analysis_4 ✔️
7. GT analysis_7 → predicted analysis_13 ✔️
8. GT analysis_8 → predicted analysis_7 ✔️
9. GT analysis_9 → predicted analysis_9 ✔️
10. GT analysis_10 → predicted analysis_5 ✔️
11. GT analysis_11 → predicted analysis_15 ✔️
12. GT analysis_12 → predicted analysis_3 ✔️
13. GT analysis_13 → predicted analysis_2 ✔️
14. GT analysis_14 → predicted analysis_10 ✔️
15. GT analysis_15 → predicted analysis_11 ✔️

All 15 analyses are correctly matched. Now check for any inaccuracies in their parameters:

For example, in predicted analysis_1 (GT analysis_5), the label groups are correctly set. 

Another check: analysis_10 in GT (analysis_10 is "Single cell Transcriptomics" on data_11 → predicted analysis_5 does that. Correct.

What about analysis_14 in predicted (analysis_14 is "Spatial transcriptome" on data_9 (GT data_12). Correct.

The only potential issue is the analysis_12 in predicted's name. Wait, predicted analysis_12 is "Single cell Transcriptomics" with data_6,10,1. But those correspond to GT data_1, data_10, data_3. Which is correct for GT analysis_1. So that's okay.

Another check: analysis_6 in predicted (GT analysis_4) has the right datasets. Yes.

So accuracy-wise, everything seems correct. 

Completeness: All 15 analyses are present, so 100%. No missing or extra analyses.

Thus, Analyses component scores:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, correct keys).

Accuracy: 100 (all analyses correctly represented).

Completeness: 100 (all present).

Wait, but hold on! Wait in GT analysis_14 is "Functional Enrichment Analysis" using analysis_13 (GT analysis_13 is Single cell Clustering from analysis_12). In predicted, analysis_10 has "Functional Enrichment Analysis" using analysis_2 (which is the counterpart of GT analysis_13). So that's correct.

Hmm, so all correct. Therefore, Analyses component also gets 100.

Wait, but what about the analysis IDs? The problem states not to penalize mismatched IDs if content is correct. Since the content is correct, IDs don't matter. So yes.

Wait another thought: In GT analysis_1's analysis_data is ["data_1", "data_2", "data_3"], which in predicted analysis_12 is ["data_6", "data_10", "data_1"]. These correspond to the correct data entries, so that's accurate.

Yes, so Analyses score is 100.

**Results Component**

Wait, looking back at the ground truth and predicted annotations, the "results" section isn't present in either. The ground truth has "data", "analyses", and "article_id". The user's task mentions evaluating "Results" as a component, but neither the ground truth nor the predicted annotation include a "results" section. 

This is a problem. The user's input says the annotation has three components: Data, Analyses, Results. But in the provided ground truth and predicted, there's no "results" key. Therefore, the results component is entirely missing from both. 

According to the scoring criteria, the results component must be evaluated. Since both lack it, how do we handle this?

The ground truth doesn't have results, so the predicted also lacks it. Therefore, the completeness for results is 0, because there are no results in either. But since the ground truth also has nothing, maybe completeness is 100? Wait no, the completeness is about how well the predicted covers the ground truth. Since the ground truth has nothing in results, the predicted having nothing is perfect. But if the results were supposed to exist but aren't present, that's different.

Wait, the problem says "the annotation contains three main components: Data, Analyses, Results". The user provided ground truth and predicted annotations both lack "results". Therefore, the ground truth's results component is empty. Thus, the predicted also has none. 

So for Results component:

Structure: The component is present as an empty array or missing? Looking at the ground truth JSON provided, there is no "results" key. The user's ground truth includes "data", "analyses", but not "results". Similarly, the predicted also lacks "results". 

Therefore, both have no results section. So structure-wise, the absence is okay? Or is it invalid because the component is missing?

The scoring criteria says "Confirm that the component is valid JSON". If the component is missing, it's invalid. Because the three components must be present. 

The ground truth is missing "results", so it's invalid? But the user provides the ground truth as the reference. Since the ground truth lacks "results", then the predicted also lacking it would be structurally correct (since it's following the ground truth's structure). But according to the task's initial description, the annotation should have three components including Results. 

This is conflicting. Since the ground truth provided by the user doesn't include Results, perhaps the Results component is not required here? Or maybe it's an oversight.

Alternatively, perhaps the "results" component is optional, but the problem states it's one of three main components. 

Assuming that both GT and predicted lack the "results" component, then for structure:

- The ground truth is invalid because it's missing a required component (Results). But since the user provided it, we have to treat it as the ground truth. 

The predicted also lacks it, so structurally it matches the ground truth's structure (both missing Results). So structure score for Results would be 100? Because it's valid JSON (they both omit it), but according to the criteria, each component must be present. Wait, the criteria says "the annotation contains three main components". If they're missing, then structure is invalid.

Hmm, this is ambiguous. Since the problem states that the annotations have those three components, but the provided examples don't include Results, maybe there's an error. Alternatively, maybe Results are not part of the provided data, so perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to proceed.

Given that both the ground truth and predicted lack the "results" component, we can consider that the "results" section is not present in either, so the predicted's absence mirrors the ground truth's. 

For the Results component:

Structure: If the presence of the three components is required, then both are missing Results, making their structure invalid. But since the ground truth is the reference, perhaps the presence of Results is not mandatory here. 

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and Results is not expected. Given that the user's input shows that neither has "results", perhaps the Results component isn't part of this particular example. However, the user explicitly listed Results as one of the three components to evaluate. 

Since both are missing it, the structure score would be 0 because the component is missing (invalid JSON structure as per the criteria requiring all three). But if the ground truth is missing it, then the predicted's structure is valid compared to the ground truth's structure. 

This is confusing. To resolve:

The scoring criteria says "each component contains multiple objects". So each of Data, Analyses, Results must be present as a component. 

In the ground truth, the "results" component is missing, so its structure is invalid. But since it's the ground truth, we have to accept it. The predicted also lacks it, so its structure matches the ground truth's structure (both missing it). So for structure, it's valid as per the ground truth's structure, hence structure score 100.

However, the criteria might require all three components to be present. Since the ground truth lacks Results, the predicted's omission is correct. So structure is okay.

Accuracy: Since there are no results in either, accuracy is 100 (no mismatches).

Completeness: 100 (nothing to cover).

Wait, but if the Results component is supposed to exist but isn't present in either, then completeness is 0? Or since the ground truth has nothing, completeness is 100?

The completeness is measured by how well the predicted covers the ground truth. Since the ground truth has nothing in Results, the predicted having nothing is complete. So completeness is 100. 

Therefore, Results component scores:

Structure: 100 (since both lack it, but structurally valid as per their own structure).

Accuracy: 100 (no content to compare, so perfect match).

Completeness: 100 (covers all, which is zero).

Thus, all components get 100. 

Wait, but this seems unlikely. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the Results component should have been present, but the user didn't include it in either, so it's a trick question. Alternatively, maybe the Results are in another part. 

Rechecking the user's input:

The ground truth provided by the user includes "data" and "analyses" arrays under the article_id, but no "results". The task says the annotation has three components: Data, Analyses, Results. Since neither has Results, perhaps the correct approach is that both have zero in Results, so:

For Results component:

Structure: The component must exist as a valid JSON array. Since it's absent in both, it's invalid structure. But the ground truth is missing it, so the predicted is structurally identical to GT, hence structure is okay (100). 

Accuracy: Since there are no results in GT, the predicted's lack is accurate (100).

Completeness: 100 (covered everything, which is zero). 

Hence, Results score is 100.

Therefore, all components get 100. But this feels odd. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, the user's initial instruction says "You will be given the ground truth annotation of a multiomics research paper." The example ground truth provided by the user does not have a "results" section. So perhaps the results are not part of the given data, so the Results component is not required here. Hence, the evaluation proceeds as above.

Thus, the final scores would be all 100. But that seems high. Did I make a mistake?

Wait let me recheck Analyses:

Wait in GT analysis_15 is "ATAC-seq" on data_14. In predicted analysis_11, it's on data_3 (which is GT data_14). Correct.

Also, in predicted analysis_6 ("Transcriptomics"), the data entries are correctly mapped.

Another check: GT analysis_5 has analysis_data ["analysis_4"], which in predicted analysis_1 refers to analysis_6 (GT analysis_4's ID is analysis_4, which maps to predicted analysis_6). So analysis_1's analysis_data is ["analysis_6"], which is correct. 

Yes, all seems correct. 

Therefore, all components score 100. But the user might have intended some deductions. Let me check again:

Wait in the Data component, predicted data_3 has "omics": "ATAC-seq", "sourse": "" (same as GT). The "source" field in GT data_14 is misspelled as "sourse", so the predicted's "sourse" is correct. So no issue.

Another possible oversight: In GT Data_13 (GSE200315), the format is "raw and processed Visium...", which matches predicted Data_7's format. 

Yes, all correct. So scores are indeed all 100.
