## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**Data Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each data entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   All six data entries are present in the annotation result.
    *   However, the order of `omics` values are changed. Deduct 10 points.
*   **Content Accuracy (35/50):**
    *   Most of the key-value pairs are accurately transcribed.
    *   The `omics` field has some inaccuracies: `data_1` is incorrectly labeled as "Proteomics" instead of "Transcriptomics", and `data_4` is incorrectly labeled as "Transcriptomics" instead of "". Deduct 15 points.

    **Total Data Score: 75/100**

**Analyses Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each analysis entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (25/40):**
    *   All 13 analysis entries are present in the annotation result.
    *   However, the order of analysis entries and `analysis_data` within each entry is altered. Although the contents are there, it impacts readability and potentially downstream processing. Deduct 15 points.
*   **Content Accuracy (30/50):**
    *   There are some inaccuracies in the `analysis_data` lists. Some analyses are associated with incorrect data IDs. For instance, `analysis_1` is linked to "data_5" instead of "data_5". Deduct 20 points.

    **Total Analyses Score: 65/100**

**Results Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each result entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   All five result entries are present in the annotation result.
    *   The order of result entries is altered. Deduct 10 points.
*   **Content Accuracy (35/50):**
    *   The `features` lists generally match, but the order is different.
    *   The `analysis_id` is correct for all results.
    *   Deduct 15 points for features ordering differences.

    **Total Results Score: 75/100**
