## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**General Notes:**

*   The scoring prioritizes semantic correctness over exact string matching.
*   Optional fields are evaluated less strictly.
*   ID mismatches are ignored as long as the content is equivalent.

### 1. Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and follows the expected format. Key-value pairs within each data entry are correctly structured.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   There are some mismatches in `omics` field between annotation and ground truth. Specifically, `data_1` and `data_2` have swapped omics types.
    *   All required keys (`id`, `omics`, `link`, `format`, `source`, `public_id`) are present in each sub-object.
    *   Deduction: -10 points for the incorrect `omics` assignments.
*   **Content Accuracy (8/50):**
    *   Due to the swap of 'omics' in `data_1` and `data_2`, the values associated with those fields are inaccurate.
    *   Other fields like `link`, `format`, `source`, and `public_id` are mostly accurate.
    *   Deduction: -42 points for the inaccuracies in 'omics' field.

**Total Data Score: 48/100**

### 2. Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid.  Key-value pairs within each analysis entry are well-formed.
*   **Content Completeness (70/100):**
    *   Most analyses are present in both the ground truth and the annotation result.
    *   However, the connections between analyses via `analysis_data` differ significantly. Several analyses have different parent analyses.
    *   Specifically, the relationship between `analysis_4`, `analysis_5`, `analysis_6`, `analysis_7`, `analysis_8`, `analysis_9` and `analysis_10` are different in the annotation result.
    *   Deduction: -30 points for substantial differences in the relationships between analyses.
*   **Content Accuracy (50/50):**
    *   Where `analysis_data` refers to single analyses (e.g., `analysis_3`), the accuracy is high.
    *   The `label` section in `analysis_10` is correctly represented.
    *   Since the overall structure of analysis dependencies is different, there's an inherent inaccuracy in how the analyses relate to each other. However, individual analysis names and their immediate data dependencies are generally accurate.

**Total Analyses Score: 130/100**

### 3. Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, with appropriate key-value pairs.
*   **Content Completeness (40/40):**
    *   The `results` object contains the expected `analysis_id`, `features`, `metrics`, and `value` keys.
    *   Only one result is provided which is consistent with the ground truth.
*   **Content Accuracy (45/50):**
    *   The `analysis_id` is accurately linked to the corresponding analysis.
    *   The `features` list appears identical to the ground truth.
    *   The `metrics` and `value` lists are identical to the ground truth.
    *   Deduction: -5 points for minor formatting differences (e.g. whitespace).

**Total Results Score: 95/100**
