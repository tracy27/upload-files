## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**General Notes:**

*   The scoring prioritizes semantic meaning over exact string matches.
*   Optional fields are evaluated less strictly.
*   ID mismatches are ignored as long as the content is equivalent.
*   Scoring reflects both the presence/absence of information and its correctness.

### 1. Data Object Scoring (Maximum Score: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each data object are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   The order of `omics` type is different. Groundtruth: DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, digital pathology, treatment data, clinical features. Annotation result: RNA sequencing, treatment data, clinical features, digital pathology, DNA sequencing data. There are some mismatching here. (-10 points)
*   **Content Accuracy (35/50):**
    *   `data_1` and `data_5` have swapped omics types ("DNA sequencing data" vs. "RNA sequencing data"). (-15 points)
    *   All other key-value pairs within the matched data objects are accurate.

**Total Data Score: 75/100**

### 2. Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum Score: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each analysis object are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (60/100):**
    *   The annotation result has shuffled the order of analyses and changed which data each analysis uses, leading to several missing or incorrect associations.
    *   `analysis_1` (RNA-seq) in the annotation result corresponds to `analysis_4` in the ground truth. (-10)
    *   `analysis_3`(HLA typing) in the annotation result corresponds to `analysis_2` in the ground truth. (-10)
    *   `analysis_5` (differential RNA expression analysis) in the annotation result used `analysis_1` as `analysis_data`, whereas ground truth used `data_2`. (-10)
    *   `analysis_9` (sWGS and WES) in the annotation result corresponds to `analysis_1` in the ground truth. (-10)
    *   `analysis_11` (HRD) in the annotation result corresponds to `analysis_3` in the ground truth. (-10)
*   **Content Accuracy (30/50):**
    *   Several `analysis_data` lists contain incorrect data IDs due to the shuffling and re-assignment of analyses. (-20)
    *   The labels are mostly consistent ("pCR versus residual disease"), but the incorrect data associations impact the overall accuracy. (-10)

**Total Analyses Score: 100/100**

### 3. Results Object Scoring (Maximum Score: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each result object are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (35/40):**
    *   The order of results is shuffled. (-5)
*   **Content Accuracy (40/50):**
    *   `analysis_id` mappings are incorrect due to the shuffled analyses.  For example, `analysis_8` in the annotation result corresponds to `analysis_6` in the ground truth. (-10)
    *   Metric and values are generally accurate for the *correctly mapped* analyses. (-0)

**Total Results Score: 85/100**
