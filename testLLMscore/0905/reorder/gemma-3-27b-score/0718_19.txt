## Scoring Annotation Result against Ground Truth

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring process for the provided annotation result, compared to the ground truth.

**1. Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The structure is perfect. Both annotation and ground truth have a list of dictionaries, each with the specified keys ('format', 'id', 'link', 'omics', 'public_id', 'source'). No structural issues. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**  The annotation result contains two data objects, exactly matching the ground truth in terms of number and type of data objects. All expected sub-objects are present. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):** All key-value pairs within each data object match the ground truth precisely. There are no discrepancies in omics type, public ID, or source. **Score: 50/50**

**Total Data Score: 100/100**

**2. Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The structure is perfect. Both annotation and ground truth have a list containing one dictionary, and the key-value pairs within are correctly formatted. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):** The annotation result contains one analysis object, matching the ground truth. All expected sub-objects are present. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):** The `analysis_name`, `analysis_data` and `label` all match the ground truth.  There are no discrepancies in the values. **Score: 50/50**

**Total Analyses Score: 100/100**

**3. Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The structure is perfect. Both annotation and ground truth have an empty list. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):** Both the annotation result and the ground truth have an empty list for results. Since the ground truth is missing this section, we skip scoring it. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):** N/A - skipped because the ground truth has no results section. **Score: 50/50**

**Total Results Score: 100/100**
