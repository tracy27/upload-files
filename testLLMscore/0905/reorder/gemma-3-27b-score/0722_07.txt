## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring process for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**Data Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and conforms to the expected format. Key-value pairs within each data entry are correctly structured.
*   **Content Completeness (32/40):**
    *   All four data entries are present in both the ground truth and the annotation result. However, the order of `omics` types is different. Specifically, "single-cell RNA-seq data" and "bulk RNA-seq data" are swapped in the annotation result compared to the ground truth. Although the content is present, this impacts completeness slightly. (-8 points).
*   **Content Accuracy (48/50):**
    *   The `omics` type, `source`, and `public_id` values are accurately transcribed for "bulk RNA-seq data", "metabolomics data", and "proteomics data".
    *   The `omics` type for “single-cell RNA-seq data” is swapped with bulk RNA-seq data. (-2 points)

    **Total Data Score: 90/100**

**Analyses Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and consistent with expectations. Key-value pairs are correctly formed within each analysis entry.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   All six analyses are present in both. However, there are discrepancies in the `analysis_data` field for some analyses. `analysis_1` uses `data_2` instead of `data_1`. `analysis_5` includes `analysis_6` which is incorrect. (-10 points)
*   **Content Accuracy (40/50):**
    *   `analysis_2` and `analysis_6` are correctly mapped.
    *   `analysis_3` is correctly mapped.
    *   `analysis_4` is correctly mapped.
    *   As noted above, `analysis_1` and `analysis_5` have errors in their `analysis_data` references, resulting in inaccuracies. (-10 points)

    **Total Analyses Score: 80/100**

**Results Object Scoring:**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and adheres to the expected format. Key-value pairs are appropriately defined.
*   **Content Completeness (40/40):** The single result entry is present in both the ground truth and the annotation result. All expected sub-objects are included.
*   **Content Accuracy (50/50):**
    *   The `analysis_id`, `metrics`, and `features` are all accurately represented in the annotation result, matching the ground truth perfectly.

    **Total Results Score: 100/100**
