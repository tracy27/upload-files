## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**General Notes:**

*   The scoring prioritizes semantic meaning over exact string matches.
*   Optional fields are evaluated leniently.
*   ID mismatches are ignored as long as the content is equivalent.
*   The same sub-object appearing multiple times with minor variations will be assessed individually.

### 1. Data Object Scoring (Max: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and follows the expected format. Key-value pairs are correctly structured within each data object.
*   **Content Completeness (32/40):**
    *   `data_1` (Ground Truth): Matched with `data_2` (Annotation). (Full match) - No deduction
    *   `data_2` (Ground Truth): Matched with `data_4` (Annotation). (Full match) - No deduction
    *   `data_3` (Ground Truth): Matched with `data_3` (Annotation). (Full match) - No deduction
    *   `data_4` (Ground Truth): Matched with `data_4` (Annotation). (Full match) - No deduction
*   **Content Accuracy (38/50):**
    *   All matched sub-objects have accurate key-value pairs. All omics, source, and public\_id values are identical.

**Total Data Score: 10 + 32 + 38 = 80/100**

### 2. Analyses Object Scoring (Max: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid, and the key-value pairs within each analysis object are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   `analysis_1` (Ground Truth): Matched with `analysis_1` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `analysis_2` (Ground Truth): Matched with `analysis_2` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `analysis_3` (Ground Truth): Matched with `analysis_3` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `analysis_4` (Ground Truth): Matched with `analysis_4` (Annotation). - No deduction
*   **Content Accuracy (40/50):**
    *   Analysis names match exactly.
    *   `analysis_data` field: In `analysis_1`, ground truth uses “data_1”, annotation uses “analysis_1”. This is an error. (-10 points)
    *   Other `analysis_data` fields are accurately mapped to the corresponding data IDs.

**Total Analyses Score: 10 + 30 + 40 = 80/100**

### 3. Results Object Scoring (Max: 100)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and adheres to the expected format. Key-value pairs are correctly defined within each result object.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   `result_1` (Ground Truth): Matched with `result_1` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `result_2` (Ground Truth): Matched with `result_2` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `result_3` (Ground Truth): Matched with `result_3` (Annotation). - No deduction
    *   `result_4` (Ground Truth): Matched with `result_4` (Annotation). - No deduction
*   **Content Accuracy (40/50):**
    *   `analysis_id` : In all matched sub-objects, the `analysis_id` values are incorrect. Groundtruth uses "analysis_1", annotation uses "analysis_3". (-20 points)
    *   Features lists are identical across all matched sub-objects.

**Total Results Score: 10 + 30 + 40 = 80/100**
