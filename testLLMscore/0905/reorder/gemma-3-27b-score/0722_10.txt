## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid. Key-value pairs within each data entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (25/40):**
    *   The annotation result misses `data_1` which is present in groundtruth. (-10 points).
    *   The order of data objects differs, but this doesn't affect completeness as long as the content is present.
    *   There is an extra `data_5`, but it's a valid entry so no penalty.
*   **Content Accuracy (30/50):**
    *   `data_2`: Omics and other details match perfectly (5/5).
    *   `data_3`: Omics and other details match perfectly (5/5).
    *   `data_4` (first instance): Omics and other details match perfectly (5/5).
    *   `data_4` (second instance): Omics and other details match perfectly (5/5).
    *   `data_5`: Omics and other details match perfectly (5/5).
    *   Overall, good accuracy in the included data entries.

    **Total Data Score: 65/100**

**Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid. Key-value pairs within each analysis entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (20/40):**
    *   `analysis_1`: Present in both, but `analysis_data` are different. (-10 points)
    *   `analysis_2`: Present in both, `analysis_data` are different. (-5 points)
    *   `analysis_3`: Present in both, `analysis_data` are identical.
    *   `analysis_4`: Present in both, `analysis_data` are different. (-5 points)
    *   `analysis_5`: Present in both, `analysis_data` are identical.
    *   `analysis_6`: Present in both, `analysis_data` are different. (-5 points)
*   **Content Accuracy (30/50):**
    *   `analysis_1`: `analysis_data` has discrepancies. (-10 points)
    *   `analysis_2`: `analysis_data` has discrepancies. (-5 points)
    *   `analysis_3`: `analysis_data` matches perfectly. (5/5)
    *   `analysis_4`: `analysis_data` has discrepancies. (-5 points)
    *   `analysis_5`: `analysis_data` matches perfectly. (5/5)
    *   `analysis_6`: `analysis_data` has discrepancies. (-10 points)

    **Total Analyses Score: 60/100**

**Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid. Key-value pairs within the result entry are correctly formatted.
*   **Content Completeness (40/40):** The result entry is present and contains all the expected sub-objects.
*   **Content Accuracy (50/50):**
    *   `analysis_id` matches.
    *   `metrics` and `value` are empty in both, so they match.
    *   `features` list matches exactly.

    **Total Results Score: 100/100**
