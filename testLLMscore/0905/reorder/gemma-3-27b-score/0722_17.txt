## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**General Notes:**

*   The scoring prioritizes semantic meaning over exact string matches.
*   Optional fields are evaluated less strictly.
*   ID mismatches are ignored as long as the content is equivalent.

### 1. Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and consistent with the expected format. Key-value pairs within each data entry are correctly structured.
*   **Content Completeness (35/40):**
    *   All four data entries are present in both the ground truth and the annotation result. However, the order of `omics` is different. Since the content is the same, it does not affect the completeness score. (-5 points)
*   **Content Accuracy (95/100):**
    *   All `omics`, `link`, `format`, `source`, and `public_id` values match perfectly between corresponding data entries. No errors found. (-5 points due to the order difference)

    **Total Data Score: 140/150 = 93.33**

### 2. Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and well-formed. Key-value pairs within each analysis entry are correctly structured.
*   **Content Completeness (30/40):**
    *   Most analyses are present. However, there are some differences. `analysis_4` and `analysis_6` in the ground truth have been swapped with `analysis_5` and `analysis_6`. Also, `analysis_3` in annotation result has `analysis_5` in its `analysis_data` which is incorrect. (-10 points)
*   **Content Accuracy (70/100):**
    *   `analysis_1` and `analysis_2` are completely accurate.
    *   `analysis_3`: The `analysis_data` field should contain `analysis_2` and `analysis_5`, but it contains `analysis_2` and `analysis_5`. (-10 points)
    *   `analysis_4`: The `analysis_data` field should contain `analysis_2` and `analysis_3`, but it contains `analysis_2` and `analysis_5`. (-10 points)
    *   `analysis_5`: The `analysis_data` field is correct.
    *   `analysis_6`: The `analysis_data` field is correct.

    **Total Analyses Score: 110/150 = 73.33**

### 3. Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 Points)

*   **Structure (10/10):** The JSON structure is valid and conforms to the expected format. Key-value pairs within each result entry are correctly structured.
*   **Content Completeness (35/40):**
    *   All four result entries are present. However, the order of the results is different from the ground truth. (-5 points).
*   **Content Accuracy (95/100):**
    *   `analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, and `features` all match accurately for each corresponding result entry. No errors detected. (-5 points due to the order difference)

    **Total Results Score: 140/150 = 93.33**
