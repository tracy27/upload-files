## Annotation Scoring

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring process for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid. All key-value pairs are present as expected within each data entry. - **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   Both `data_1` and `data_2` are present in the annotation and match the ground truth. - **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   All key-value pairs within `data_1` and `data_2` perfectly match the ground truth. - **Score: 50/50**

**Total Data Score: 100/100**

**Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid. Key-value pairs are correctly formatted within each analysis entry. - **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   All four analyses (`analysis_1`, `analysis_2`, `analysis_3`, `analysis_4`) are present in the annotation. However, the order and `analysis_data` contents differ from the ground truth.
    *   `analysis_1`: Ground truth `analysis_data` is `["analysis_3", "analysis_2"]`, while annotation has `["analysis_3", "analysis_2"]`. They are equivalent.
    *   `analysis_2`: Ground truth `analysis_data` is `["data_2"]`, and annotation has `["data_2"]`. They are equivalent.
    *   `analysis_3`: Ground truth `analysis_data` is `["data_1"]`, and annotation has `["data_1"]`. They are equivalent.
    *   `analysis_4`: Ground truth `analysis_data` is `["analysis_1"]`, and annotation has `["analysis_1"]`. They are equivalent.
    *   Although the order is different, all the analyses are present and their relationships are maintained. - **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   The `analysis_name` and `analysis_data` values are all correct for each analysis when considering semantic equivalence. - **Score: 50/50**

**Total Analyses Score: 100/100**

**Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid. Key-value pairs are correctly formatted within the result entry. - **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   The single result entry is present in the annotation and matches the ground truth. - **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   `analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, and `features` all perfectly match the ground truth. - **Score: 50/50**

**Total Results Score: 100/100**
