## Annotation Scoring Report

Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring process for the provided annotation result, compared against the ground truth.

**Data Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid and follows the expected format. Key-value pairs within each data object are correctly structured. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   All 5 data objects are present in both the ground truth and the annotation result. However, the order is different.
    *   The `omics`, `source`, `link`, `format`, and `public_id` keys are all present in each object in both versions.
    *   No missing sub-objects. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   `data_1`: Omics is "Gene expression profiles" in GT vs "Gene expression profiles" in AR. Source is "Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)" in both. Link is "" in both. Public_id is "GSE25724" in AR vs "GSE38642" in GT. **-10 points**
    *   `data_2`: Omics is "" in AR vs GT. Source is "GEO database" in both. Link is "" in both. Public_id is "GSE77943" in both. **-10 points**
    *   `data_3`: Omics is "DNA methylation profiles" in both. Source is "Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)" in both. Link is "" in both. Public_id is "GSE21232" in both. **Score: 0/0**
    *   `data_4`: Omics is "Gene expression profiles" in both. Source is "Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)" in both. Link is "" in both. Public_id is "GSE38642" in both. **Score: 0/0**
    *   `data_5`: Omics is "Genomics" in both. Source is "Mergeomics web server" in both. Link is "" in both. Public_id is "Nature 536(7614): 41–47." in both. **Score: 0/0**
    *   Total Deduction: 20 points
    *   **Score: 30/50**

**Total Data Score: 10 + 40 + 30 = 80/100**

**Analyses Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid, and key-value pairs are correctly formatted. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   All 5 analysis objects are present in both the ground truth and the annotation result.
    *   The `analysis_name` and `analysis_data`/`training_set`/`test_set` keys are present as expected.
    *   The order of analyses differs, but all analyses are represented.
    *   No missing sub-objects. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   `analysis_1`: `analysis_data` is `["data_4", "data_3", "data_5"]` in AR vs `["data_1", "data_2", "data_4"]` in GT. **-20 points**
    *   `analysis_2`: `analysis_data` is `["analysis_3"]` in AR vs `[]` in GT. **-10 points**
    *   `analysis_3`: `training_set` is `["data_4", "data_3", "data_5"]` in AR vs `["data_1", "data_2", "data_4"]` in GT; `test_set` is `["data_1", "data_2"]` in AR vs `["data_3", "data_5"]` in GT. **-20 points**
    *   `analysis_4`: `analysis_data` is `["analysis_3"]` in both. **Score: 0/0**
    *   `analysis_5`: `analysis_data` is `["analysis_2"]` in both. **Score: 0/0**
    *   Total Deduction: 50 points
    *   **Score: 0/50**

**Total Analyses Score: 10 + 40 + 0 = 50/100**

**Results Object Scoring (Maximum 100 points)**

*   **Structure (10 points):** The JSON structure is valid, and key-value pairs are correctly formatted. **Score: 10/10**
*   **Content Completeness (40 points):**
    *   Only one result object is present in both ground truth and annotation result.
    *   All expected keys (`analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`) are present.
    *   No missing sub-objects. **Score: 40/40**
*   **Content Accuracy (50 points):**
    *   `analysis_id` is "analysis_3" in AR vs "analysis_2" in GT. **-10 points**
    *   `metrics` is "AUC" in both.
    *   `value` is identical in both.
    *   `features` is identical in both.
    *   Total Deduction: 10 points
    *   **Score: 40/50**

**Total Results Score: 10 + 40 + 40 = 90/100**
