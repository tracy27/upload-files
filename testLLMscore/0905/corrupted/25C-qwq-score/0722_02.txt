Okay, I need to score the annotation result against the groundtruth provided. Let me start by understanding the task requirements again.

First, the user wants scores for three objects: data, analyses, and results. Each has a max of 100 points, broken down into structure (10), content completeness (40), and content accuracy (50). 

Starting with the "data" object. Both groundtruth and the annotation have exactly 8 data entries. Let me check each one for structure, completeness, and accuracy.

**Structure for Data:** 
Groundtruth and the result both have arrays of objects with keys like id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. All required keys are present. The optional ones like link and format are okay even if empty. So structure looks good. Full 10 points.

**Content Completeness for Data:** 
Each data entry in groundtruth must be present in the result. Looking at each:

- data_1 to data_8 in groundtruth. In the result, all 8 are there with same IDs? Wait, no. Wait, the IDs in the result's data entries are the same as groundtruth? The IDs are data_1 to data_8 in both. But the user mentioned that IDs don't matter, just the content. Wait, actually, the IDs are part of the structure. Since the IDs are present, but maybe the order is different? But since they are arrays, order doesn't matter here. The key is whether all sub-objects exist. Comparing each:

Check each data entry's omics, source, public_id. The source and public_id arrays must match exactly?

Looking at data_5 in groundtruth: format is empty. In the result, it has "raw files". But format is optional. So that's okay, no penalty. The rest of the fields (omics, source, public_id) are the same. So each data entry is present. So content completeness is full 40 points? Wait, but wait, the groundtruth's data_5 has an empty format, but the annotation added "raw files". Since format is optional, even if it's filled in, it's allowed. The presence of the sub-object is what's important here. Since all 8 are present, completeness is 40.

Wait, but maybe I missed something? Let me recheck:

All 8 data entries are present in the annotation. Each has the same omics type, sources, public_ids. So yes, completeness is full. So 40.

**Content Accuracy for Data:** Now check each sub-object's key-value pairs for correctness.

For each data entry:

- data_1 to data_8: omics matches exactly? Yes, like Serology, Olink etc. Sources are same arrays. Public IDs are same. Link and format are optional; in groundtruth they're empty, in some cases the result has "raw files" for data_5's format. Since optional fields can vary, this isn't penalized. So all key-value pairs are accurate except maybe format in data_5. But since format is optional, the groundtruth allows any value. So the presence of "raw files" is acceptable. So all accurate. Full 50 points. Total data score: 10+40+50=100? Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, does the "format" field in data_5 count as a discrepancy? Groundtruth has empty string, annotation has "raw files". But since format is optional, the scorer shouldn't penalize for adding extra info unless it's incorrect. Since "raw files" could be a valid format, but the groundtruth didn't include it, but since it's optional, maybe it's allowed. Alternatively, if the groundtruth expects it to be empty, but since it's optional, the presence of a value might not be a problem. So probably no deduction here. So data gets 100.

Now moving to "analyses".

**Structure for Analyses:**
Check if each analysis sub-object has the right keys: id, analysis_name, analysis_data. Also, analysis_data can be an array or string (since in groundtruth, sometimes it's written as ["data_8"] vs "data_8"). The result uses both formats. However, the structure requires that the keys exist. The analysis_data being an array or single string is okay as long as the structure has the key. The groundtruth has analysis_data as both array and string in some cases (like analysis_10 has "data_8", others have arrays). The annotation's analyses also mix array and strings. The structure's requirement is just presence, so structure is okay. 10 points.

**Content Completeness for Analyses:**
Groundtruth has 17 analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_17). The annotation has analyses_1 to analyses_17, but looking at the list:

Groundtruth's analyses list:
analysis_1 to analysis_17 (count them):

Groundtruth analyses count: Let's see, the groundtruth's analyses array has 17 items (from analysis_1 up to analysis_17). The annotation's analyses array has 16 items? Wait let me recount:

In the groundtruth's analyses array:

analysis_1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 → 17 items.

Annotation's analyses array:

analysis_1, 2, 3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 → that's 15 entries. Wait, let me count again:

Looking at the annotation's analyses:

1. analysis_1

2. analysis_2

3. analysis_3

4. analysis_4

5. analysis_6 (missing 5)

6. analysis_7

7. analysis_8

8. analysis_9

9. analysis_10

10. analysis_11

11. analysis_12

12. analysis_13

13. analysis_14

14. analysis_16 (missing 15)

15. analysis_17

Total 15 items. So two missing: analysis_5 and analysis_15.

Therefore, the content completeness is missing 2 sub-objects. Since each missing sub-object would deduct (40 / total_groundtruth_sub_objects) per missing. The groundtruth has 17 sub-objects, so each missing is (40/17)*2 ≈ ~4.7 points per missing? Wait, the scoring says for content completeness, deduct points for missing any sub-object. The total possible is 40, so each missing sub-object would deduct (40/17)*number missing? Or is it a fixed amount?

The instruction says: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object." It doesn't specify per missing item, but I think it's proportional. Since there are 17 in groundtruth, each missing is (40/17)*1, so 2 missing would be 80/17 ≈4.7 points off. So 40 - 4.7≈35.3. But perhaps the user expects to deduct 40*(number_missing / total). That's the way to calculate it. So 40*(15/17)? Wait no, because missing 2, so the penalty is 2/17 of 40? Wait, the instruction says "deduct points for missing any sub-object". Maybe each missing sub-object deducts (40 / total_groundtruth_sub_objects) * number_missing. So total_completeness = 40 - ( (number_missing / total_groundtruth) ) *40 ?

Alternatively, maybe each missing sub-object deducts (40 / total_groundtruth) per missing. Since there are 17, each missing is (40/17) ≈2.35 points. Two missing would be ~4.7, so total 40-4.7≈35.3, rounded to 35. But maybe the system is stricter. Alternatively, if the annotation has fewer sub-objects, then (actual_subobjects / total_groundtruth_subobjects) *40. So 15/17 *40 ≈ 35.29. So 35.29, rounded to 35. So content completeness is 35.

But wait, the groundtruth may have some analyses that the annotator omitted. Let me confirm which analyses are missing.

Looking at the groundtruth's analyses:

The missing analyses in the annotation are:

analysis_5: analysis_5 in groundtruth is "Differential analysis" with analysis_data pointing to analysis_4.

analysis_15: analysis_15 is "Genomics" with analysis_data: data_7.

So these two are missing in the annotation's analyses array. So yes, two missing. Hence the deduction.

Additionally, checking for extra sub-objects in the annotation that aren't in the groundtruth. The annotation has analysis_9 which has analysis_data pointing to analysis_10, but analysis_10 is present in the groundtruth? Let's see:

Analysis_9 in the annotation has analysis_data: ["analysis_10"], but in groundtruth's analysis_9's analysis_data is ["analysis_7"], but in the groundtruth's analysis_9, is the analysis_data pointing to analysis_7? Wait, the groundtruth's analysis_9 has analysis_data: ["analysis_7"]? Let me check:

Groundtruth analysis_9: {"id": "analysis_9", "analysis_name": "gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)", "analysis_data": ["analysis_7"]} — yes. The annotation's analysis_9 has analysis_data: ["analysis_10"]. So that's a discrepancy, but that's part of content accuracy, not completeness. For completeness, we just count missing sub-objects. The extra ones might not count unless they are non-existent in groundtruth. Wait, the instructions say: "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." But in content completeness, it's about missing, not extras. The penalty for extras might be under content completeness or another category? Let me check the instructions again:

Under content completeness: "Note: ... Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

Hmm, so maybe if there are extra sub-objects beyond what's in the groundtruth, that could deduct points. Wait, the groundtruth has 17 analyses, the annotation has 15 (missing 2) but also possibly some extra?

Wait, the annotation has analysis_9 and analysis_14, but let's see:

Wait, let me list all the analysis IDs in the annotation:

analysis_1, 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 → total 15. The groundtruth has all up to 17, including analysis_5 and 15.

The annotation does NOT have analysis_5 and 15, but does it have any extra? Like analysis_9 and 14 are present in both. No, the IDs are the same as groundtruth except missing two. The IDs in the annotations are the same as groundtruth (except for missing two). So there are no extra sub-objects beyond the groundtruth. Thus, only the two missing are penalized. So content completeness is 40 - (2/17)*40 ≈ 35.29 → 35.

**Content Accuracy for Analyses:**

Now for each existing sub-object in the annotation that corresponds to groundtruth. We need to check for each key-value pair's accuracy, considering semantics.

First, need to map the annotation's analyses to the groundtruth's. Since IDs are different (e.g., analysis_9 exists in both but might refer to different things?), wait no, the IDs are just identifiers, so the content is what matters. So for each analysis in the annotation, find its corresponding in groundtruth based on content.

Let's go through each analysis in the annotation and compare with groundtruth:

1. **analysis_1**: same as groundtruth. analysis_name "Differential analysis", analysis_data ["data_1"]. Matches exactly. Accurate.

2. **analysis_2**: same as groundtruth. analysis_data ["data_2"], name matches. Accurate.

3. **analysis_3**: same as groundtruth. name and data. Accurate.

4. **analysis_4**: same as groundtruth. Proteomics, data_3. Accurate.

5. **analysis_6**: Groundtruth's analysis_6 is "gene co-expression... WGCNA" with analysis_data ["analysis_4"]. The annotation's analysis_6 has same name, but analysis_data is ["analysis_4"]? Wait, in the annotation's analysis_6: {"analysis_data": ["analysis_4"]}? Yes, same as groundtruth's analysis_6 (which has analysis_data ["analysis_4"]). Wait groundtruth's analysis_6 is indeed that. So matches. So analysis_6 in the annotation is accurate.

Wait, but in the groundtruth, analysis_6's analysis_data is ["analysis_4"], and the annotation's analysis_6 has the same. So accurate.

6. **analysis_7**: same as groundtruth. metabolomics with data_6. Accurate.

7. **analysis_8**: "Differential analysis" with analysis_data ["analysis_7"]. Groundtruth's analysis_8 has the same. Accurate.

8. **analysis_9**: Here's a problem. The groundtruth's analysis_9 has analysis_data ["analysis_7"], but the annotation's analysis_9 has analysis_data ["analysis_10"]. So this is a discrepancy. The analysis_name is correct ("gene co-expression..."), but the data input is wrong (pointing to analysis_10 instead of analysis_7). This is an error in the analysis_data value. So this key-value pair is incorrect. 

9. **analysis_10**: In groundtruth, analysis_10 is "Differential analysis" with analysis_data "data_8". The annotation's analysis_10 is same. Accurate.

10. **analysis_11**: Same as groundtruth. transcriptomics with data_5. Accurate.

11. **analysis_12**: "Differential analysis" with analysis_data ["analysis_11"] → matches groundtruth's analysis_12. Accurate.

12. **analysis_13**: Functional enrichment with analysis_data ["analysis_11"]. Same as groundtruth. Accurate.

13. **analysis_14**: gene co-expression with analysis_data ["analysis_11"]. Groundtruth's analysis_14 has analysis_data ["analysis_11"]. So accurate.

14. **analysis_16**: Groundtruth's analysis_16 is "Genome-wide..." with analysis_data "analysis_15". The annotation's analysis_16 has analysis_data "analysis_15". Wait, but in the annotation's analysis_16, does it have analysis_data pointing to analysis_15? The groundtruth's analysis_15 is "Genomics" with data_7, which is missing in the annotation. So in the annotation, analysis_16's analysis_data is "analysis_15", but since analysis_15 is missing in the annotation (as it was omitted), does that matter here? Wait, the analysis_16 in the annotation refers to analysis_15, which doesn't exist in the annotation's analyses. But since the groundtruth's analysis_16 refers to analysis_15 (which exists in groundtruth), but in the annotation, analysis_15 is missing, so when they refer to analysis_15, it's a broken reference. However, the content accuracy is about the key-value pairs. The analysis_data field's value is "analysis_15", which is present in the groundtruth. Even though the sub-object analysis_15 is missing in the annotation, the key-value pair in analysis_16 is correct according to the groundtruth (because in groundtruth, analysis_16 does point to analysis_15). But since analysis_15 itself is missing in the annotation, this creates inconsistency. However, the scoring criteria for content accuracy is about the key-value pairs in the matched sub-objects. 

Wait, the problem is that analysis_16 in the annotation has analysis_data: "analysis_15", but analysis_15 is missing in the annotation. However, in the groundtruth, analysis_16 does point to analysis_15 which exists there. So the key-value pair in analysis_16's analysis_data is correct (matches groundtruth's value), so that's accurate. The fact that analysis_15 is missing is part of the content completeness (already accounted for). So the analysis_data here is accurate. So analysis_16 is accurate.

15. **analysis_17**: Same as groundtruth. "metagenomics" with data_6. Accurate.

Now, looking back at analysis_9's discrepancy: The analysis_data pointing to analysis_10 instead of analysis_7. The analysis_10 is present (in both), so the link is valid, but the reference is incorrect compared to groundtruth. So this is an error in the key-value pair (analysis_data). 

Another check: analysis_9 in the groundtruth has analysis_data pointing to analysis_7, but in the annotation it's pointing to analysis_10. So this is an incorrect value. That's one error in analysis_9's analysis_data. 

Are there other errors?

Checking analysis_14 in the annotation: analysis_data is ["analysis_11"], which matches groundtruth. 

Any other mismatches? Let's see:

analysis_6's analysis_data is correct (points to analysis_4).

analysis_4's analysis_data is correct (data_3).

analysis_3's data_2 is correct.

So the only mistake is in analysis_9's analysis_data pointing to analysis_10 instead of analysis_7.

Thus, in content accuracy, there is one error in analysis_9's analysis_data. How much does this affect the score?

Each sub-object contributes to the accuracy. There are 15 sub-objects in the annotation (since 2 are missing). The groundtruth has 17 sub-objects, but we're evaluating the existing ones.

Wait, the content accuracy is for "matched sub-objects" (those that are semantically equivalent in completeness). Since the missing ones are already penalized in completeness, the accuracy is evaluated on the remaining 15.

Each of these 15 sub-objects has key-value pairs. Let's count how many key-value pairs there are per sub-object. Each analysis has three keys: id (ignored for content?), analysis_name, analysis_data. Wait, the keys to consider are analysis_name and analysis_data (since id is just an identifier and not part of content evaluation).

Wait, the instructions say: "for sub-objects deemed semantically matched in the 'Content Completeness' section, deductions are applied based on discrepancies in key-value pair semantics." 

The analysis sub-object has keys: analysis_name and analysis_data (others like id are identifiers). So per sub-object, two key-value pairs to check (excluding id). 

Wait, the analysis sub-object's keys are id (ignored), analysis_name, analysis_data, and any optional fields? The analysis_data can have analysis_data which is either array or string. 

Wait the keys are analysis_name (required), analysis_data (required?). Wait in the groundtruth, analysis_data is always present. So analysis_data is a required field. So each analysis has two key-value pairs: analysis_name and analysis_data. 

Thus, for each analysis sub-object, two key-value pairs. 

Total key-value pairs across all 15 analyses: 15 *2 =30.

Out of these, only one discrepancy: analysis_9's analysis_data. So one incorrect key-value pair.

The content accuracy is 50 points for all sub-objects. The deduction is based on the number of incorrect key-value pairs divided by total key-value pairs, multiplied by 50? Or per sub-object?

Alternatively, for each sub-object, if any key-value pair is wrong, deduct proportionally. 

The instructions say: "deductions are applied based on discrepancies in key-value pair semantics." 

Perhaps each incorrect key-value pair deducts (50 / total_key_value_pairs_in_all_sub_objects) per error.

Total key-value pairs: For each of the 15 analyses, two pairs: 30 total.

One error (analysis_9's analysis_data). 

Thus, the deduction is (1/30)*50 ≈ 1.66 points. So content accuracy would be 50 -1.66 ≈ 48.3. Rounded to 48.

Alternatively, maybe per sub-object: each sub-object has up to (50/total_sub_objects) points. Since there are 15 sub-objects, each sub-object is worth 50/15 ≈3.33 points. 

If a sub-object has an error, deduct some portion. analysis_9 has one error in its two keys. So for that sub-object, it loses half its points? 

analysis_9's contribution to accuracy is 3.33 points. If it has one incorrect key (out of two), deduct 1.66 points (half), so it gets 1.66. 

Total accuracy points would be: 

14 sub-objects with full 3.33 each: 14*3.33≈46.62

analysis_9: 1.66

Total ≈48.29. 

Either way, around 48. 

Alternatively, maybe each key is a separate point. Since there are 30 key-value pairs, each worth 50/30 ≈1.666 per. One error deducts 1.66, leading to 48.33. 

Either way, approximately 48 points for accuracy. 

Thus, analyses' total score would be structure 10 + completeness ~35 + accuracy ~48 → 93? Wait, but let's recalculate precisely.

Completeness was 35.29 (approx 35), accuracy approx 48.3 (48). So total: 10 +35 +48 = 93.

Wait but let's see:

If content completeness is 40*(15/17) = (15/17)*40 ≈35.29

Content accuracy: 50 - (1/30)*50 ≈48.33

Total analyses: 10 +35.29+48.33≈93.62 → 94?

But maybe we need to use exact fractions without rounding until the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the scorer should consider each discrepancy more significantly. For instance, in analysis_9's analysis_data, pointing to the wrong analysis is a major error. Maybe that's a full deduction for that sub-object's accuracy. 

If analysis_9 had one key wrong (analysis_data), then for that sub-object, it's 50% accuracy (since two keys, one wrong). So total accuracy points: 

For each sub-object: 

14 sub-objects with 2 correct keys: contribute fully. 

analysis_9: 1 correct (name) and 1 wrong (data). So 1/2 correct. 

Total correct key-value pairs: (14*2)+(1) =29. 

Total possible: 30. 

Accuracy score: (29/30)*50 ≈48.33. 

Thus, the content accuracy is 48.33. 

Adding up: 

Structure:10

Completeness: 40*(15/17)=35.29

Accuracy: ~48.33

Total: 10+35.29+48.33≈93.62 → round to 94. But maybe the user expects integer values. 

However, let me check again for other possible errors.

Wait, analysis_16 in the annotation has analysis_data: "analysis_15", but analysis_15 is missing in the annotation. Does that affect anything? The analysis_16's analysis_data is a reference to an analysis that doesn't exist in the annotation. However, in the groundtruth, analysis_15 exists and analysis_16 references it correctly. Since the content accuracy is about matching the groundtruth's key-values, the analysis_16's analysis_data value is correct (it points to analysis_15 as in groundtruth). Even though analysis_15 is missing, the key-value pair itself is correct. So no deduction there. 

Another thing: the analysis_9 in the annotation's analysis_data is ["analysis_10"], but in groundtruth's analysis_9 it's ["analysis_7"]. So this is a direct discrepancy. 

Is there any other discrepancy?

Looking at analysis_14 in the annotation: analysis_data is ["analysis_11"], which matches groundtruth's analysis_14. 

Yes, so only one error.

So the calculations hold.

Now, moving to "results".

**Results section:**

Both groundtruth and the annotation have empty results arrays. 

**Structure for Results:** The structure is an empty array, which matches. So full 10 points.

**Content Completeness for Results:** The groundtruth has 0 results. The annotation also has 0. So no missing sub-objects. Thus, 40 points.

**Content Accuracy for Results:** Since there are no sub-objects, nothing to deduct. Full 50.

Total results score: 10+40+50=100.

Wait, but the user says "if the ground truth has missing sections and the annotation result includes those sections, skip scoring for those parts". Since results are missing in groundtruth (empty array is considered missing?), but both have the same, so no issue.

Wait, the groundtruth's results array is empty, so the annotation's empty array matches. So no problem. Thus, full marks.

Putting it all together:

Data: 100

Analyses: ~93.6 (maybe 94)

Results: 100

But let me verify again the analyses score. 

Calculations:

Content completeness: 15/17 *40 ≈35.29

Content accuracy: (29/30)*50≈48.33

Total: 10 +35.29+48.33=93.62. Rounded to nearest whole number, 94.

Alternatively, if the scorer uses exact fractions without rounding until the end, but perhaps the instructions allow rounding to integers. 

Hence final scores:

Data: 100

Analyses: 94

Results:100

But let me double-check the analyses completeness calculation. 

Number of analyses in groundtruth:17

Missing in annotation:2 (analysis_5 and 15)

Thus, the number present in annotation:15

The completeness score is (number present / total in groundtruth)*40 → (15/17)*40 ≈35.29.

Yes.

And accuracy: as above.

Thus, the final scores would be:

"Final Scores": {

 "Data": 100,

 "Analyses": 94,

 "Results": 100

}

Wait but maybe the analyses accuracy is calculated differently. Let me think again:

Each sub-object (the 15 in the annotation) contributes to accuracy. For each, check if all key-value pairs (except id) are correct. 

There are 15 analyses. Each has two key-value pairs (analysis_name and analysis_data). 

Total key-pairs: 30.

Only one error (analysis_9's analysis_data). So correct key-pairs:29.

Accuracy is (29/30)*50 ≈48.333...

Thus, accuracy is 48.33, so total analyses: 10 +35.29 +48.33 =93.62, rounds to 94.

Alternatively, maybe the scorer deducts 2 points for each missing analysis in completeness (each missing analysis is 40/17 ≈2.35 per). So two missing is ~4.7, so 40-4.7=35.3. 

Then accuracy is 48.33.

Total 35.3+48.33+10=93.63. So 94.

Alternatively, if the scorer rounds each component to the nearest integer first:

Completeness:35

Accuracy:48

Total: 10+35+48=93. But maybe they keep decimals until the end and round the final.

But the user says to put the final score in the format with integers. So likely 94.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis_9's analysis_data. Let me check again:

Groundtruth's analysis_9 has analysis_data: ["analysis_7"]

Annotation's analysis_9 has analysis_data: ["analysis_10"]

Yes, that's a discrepancy. So that's one error in analysis_data for that sub-object. 

So that's one incorrect key-value pair. 

Thus, the calculation holds.

Another possible consideration: the analysis_9 in the groundtruth and the annotation may have different semantic meaning due to different data inputs, but since the analysis_name is correct, but the data it uses is different, the key analysis_data is a critical field. Thus, this is a significant error affecting accuracy.

Therefore, I think 94 is correct.

Now, results are perfect, data is perfect, analyses at 94.

Final scores would be as above.
</think>

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 100,
        "Analyses": 94,
        "Results": 100
    }
}

### Scoring Process Breakdown:

#### **Data Section**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  All sub-objects follow the correct JSON structure with required keys (`id`, `omics`, `source`, `public_id`). Optional keys (`link`, `format`) are present but may be empty.  

- **Content Completeness (40/40):**  
  All 8 sub-objects from the groundtruth are present in the annotation. The `format` field in `data_5` (added as "raw files") does not penalize since it is optional.  

- **Content Accuracy (50/50):**  
  All key-value pairs (e.g., `omics`, `source`, `public_id`) match exactly between groundtruth and annotation. Optional fields like `format` do not affect accuracy.  

---

#### **Analyses Section**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  All sub-objects have the required keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`). Mixed formatting (arrays vs. strings for `analysis_data`) is acceptable as long as keys exist.  

- **Content Completeness (35/40):**  
  - Groundtruth has 17 analyses; the annotation is missing **2 sub-objects** (`analysis_5` and `analysis_15`).  
  - Penalty: `(2/17) × 40 ≈ 4.7` points deducted.  
  - Final score: `40 − 4.7 ≈ 35.3` (rounded to 35).  

- **Content Accuracy (48/50):**  
  - Only one discrepancy: `analysis_9` incorrectly references `analysis_10` instead of `analysis_7` in `analysis_data`.  
  - Total key-value pairs: `15 sub-objects × 2 keys = 30`.  
  - Correct pairs: `29/30` (one error).  
  - Penalty: `(1/30) × 50 ≈ 1.67` points deducted.  
  - Final score: `50 − 1.67 ≈ 48.33` (rounded to 48).  

---

#### **Results Section**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  The `results` array is empty in both groundtruth and annotation, meeting structural requirements.  

- **Content Completeness (40/40):**  
  Both groundtruth and annotation have no results, so no penalties.  

- **Content Accuracy (50/50):**  
  No sub-objects to evaluate, so full marks.  

--- 

**Final Scores:**  
- **Data:** 100  
- **Analyses:** 94 (Structure:10 + Completeness:35 + Accuracy:48)  
- **Results:** 100
