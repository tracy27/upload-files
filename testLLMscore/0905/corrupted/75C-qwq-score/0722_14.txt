Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component: data, analyses, and results. Each has its own structure, completeness, and accuracy to evaluate.

First, let me look at the **Data** section. The groundtruth has seven data entries (data_1 to data_7), while the annotation result also has seven. But wait, I need to check if they match semantically even if the order differs. 

Starting with **Structure**: Both have the correct JSON structure for the data array and sub-objects. Each sub-object has the required keys like id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. The optional fields (link, format, public_id, source) might have variations. So structure looks okay, maybe full 10 points here.

**Content Completeness (40 points)**: For each sub-object in groundtruth, does the annotation have a corresponding one?

Looking at data_1 in groundtruth: omics is "RNA-seq", source "Gene Expression Omnibus database", public_id "GSE228842". In the annotation, data_1 has omics "RNA-seq", source "GEO database", which is a shortened form but probably equivalent. Public_id matches. Link is empty in both. So this should count as present. 

data_2 in groundtruth is "Homo sapiens genome", source HISAT2, public_id GRCh38. Annotation has "Genomics" as omics. Hmm, "Homo sapiens genome" vs "Genomics" – is that semantically close enough? Maybe not exact, but possibly considered a match. The public_id and source (HISAT2) are same, so maybe it's acceptable. 

data_3: Groundtruth has "Gene lists" from Molecular Signatures Database. Annotation says "TCGA" as source. That's different. So this would be a missing sub-object? Or maybe the user thought TCGA provides gene lists. Not sure. Need to see if there's another entry in the annotation. Looking through the rest of data in annotation: data_3 in the result has source TCGA instead of MSigDB. So that's a discrepancy. 

data_4: MicroRNA, source miRNet vs ProteomeXchange. Wait, in groundtruth data_4's source is miRNet, but annotation has ProteomeXchange? That's different. So this might be missing? Unless ProteomeXchange is an alternative name? Unlikely. So this could be a problem.

data_5: Both have "3rd gen long-read RNA-seq", same source and public_id. So okay.

data_6: Groundtruth has RNA-seq, source Gene Expression Omnibus, public_id GSE228842. Annotation's data_6 has omics RNA-seq, source National Omics Data Encyclopedia, but same public_id and link. The source is different here. Is the source critical? Since it's an optional field, maybe this is acceptable. The key elements (omics type and public_id) match, so maybe considered present.

data_7: Groundtruth is "small RNA-seq", but annotation has "Metabolome". That's a different omics type. So this is a missing sub-object. Instead, the annotation added Metabolome which wasn't in groundtruth. So that's an extra, but since groundtruth doesn't have metabolome, this counts as missing.

Wait, so how many sub-objects are missing? Let's count:

Groundtruth data entries:
1. RNA-seq (okay)
2. Homo sapiens genome (possibly okay with Genomics)
3. Gene lists (missed because TCGA vs MSigDB)
4. MicroRNA (missed due to source change)
5. 3rd gen (okay)
6. RNA-seq (maybe okay)
7. small RNA-seq (missed, replaced by Metabolome)

So data_3, data_4, and data_7 might be missing. But data_2 and data_6 have possible issues. Let me reassess:

Data_2: Groundtruth's "Homo sapiens genome" vs "Genomics". "Genomics" is a broader term. Maybe not exact, but perhaps considered as part of the same category? Alternatively, maybe the annotator mislabeled it. If they're considered different, then that's a missing sub-object. This is tricky. Since "Homo sapiens genome" is specific, whereas "Genomics" is a field, maybe this is a mismatch. So that would be another missing.

If that's the case, then data_2 is missing. So total missing sub-objects: data_2 (if considered mismatch), data_3, data_4, data_7. That's four missing out of seven. Each missing sub-object would deduct (40 points /7 per sub-object?) Wait, the instruction says deduct for missing any sub-object. How much per missing? It says "deduct points for missing any sub-object". Since there are 7 sub-objects, each worth 40/7 ≈5.71 points. So missing one would lose ~5.71, two about 11.4 etc.

But let me recount carefully:

Original groundtruth data has 7 entries. The annotation has 7 entries, but some may not correspond.

Looking again:

Groundtruth data_1 vs Anno data_1: Okay.

Groundtruth data_2 vs Anno data_2: "Homo sapiens genome" vs "Genomics". If considered mismatch, then missing. 

Groundtruth data_3 vs Anno data_3: Source is different (MSigDB vs TCGA). So unless TCGA has gene lists, which I don't think so, then this is a different sub-object. So missing.

Groundtruth data_4 vs Anno data_4: Source miRNet vs ProteomeXchange. Different sources, so mismatch. Missing.

Groundtruth data_5 vs Anno data_5: Same, okay.

Groundtruth data_6 vs Anno data_6: The source is different (Gene Expression vs National Omics...). But public_id and link same. Since source is optional, maybe acceptable. So considered present.

Groundtruth data_7 vs Anno data_7: "small RNA-seq" vs "Metabolome". Definitely different. So missing.

So total missing sub-objects: data_2, data_3, data_4, data_7 → 4 missing. So 4*(40/7)= ~22.86 points deduction. So completeness score would be 40 - ~22.86 = ~17.14. But maybe rounded. Alternatively, maybe each missing is a full point? Wait the instructions say "deduct points for missing any sub-object". It might be a flat rate per missing sub-object. Let me check the task details again.

The user wrote: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches."

Ah, so maybe each missing sub-object (from groundtruth) that isn't present in the annotation (even if they have extras) is a deduction. The penalty is per missing sub-object. The total possible points for completeness is 40, so each sub-object contributes (40/7)≈5.71 points. Since there are 7 sub-objects in groundtruth, each missing one reduces 5.71. 

Alternatively, maybe it's 40 divided equally among all sub-objects. Let me go with that approach. So 4 missing: 4 * 5.71 ≈22.86. So 40 -22.86= ~17.14. But also, if there are extra sub-objects in the annotation that aren't in the groundtruth, that might also penalize? The note says "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." 

The annotation has data_7 (metabolome), which is not in groundtruth. So that's an extra. Since the groundtruth didn't have it, adding an extra might deduct some points. How much? The instruction says "depending on contextual relevance". Since the extra is not needed, maybe deduct half the points of a missing? Not sure. Alternatively, each extra deducts 1-2 points. Maybe 1 point per extra. Here, there's 1 extra (data_7), so -1. So total completeness deduction would be 22.86 +1=23.86, leading to 40-23.86≈16.14. But I'm not sure. Maybe the penalty for extra is less. Let me consider that the main issue is missing ones first. Let's proceed with the initial calculation of ~17.14.

Now **Accuracy (50 points)** for data. For each matched sub-object, check key-value pairs. For example:

data_1: 

Omics: Both RNA-seq. Correct.

Link: Both empty, so okay. Optional field, so no penalty.

Format: Groundtruth has empty; anno has "raw files". Since format is optional, maybe allowed. No penalty here.

Source: Groundtruth "Gene Expression Omnibus database" vs "GEO database". GEO is the abbreviation, so semantically same. Correct.

Public_id: Both GSE228842. Correct. So full marks here.

data_2 (assuming it's matched as data_2):

Groundtruth omics: "Homo sapiens genome" vs anno "Genomics". Not the same. This affects accuracy. Since this is a key field (not optional?), the omics type must be accurate. So this is a discrepancy. Deduct points here. 

Assuming this sub-object is considered matched (as per completeness), but the omics field is wrong. So accuracy loss here.

Similarly, data_3 (if considered matched via data_3):

Source: MSigDB vs TCGA. Not same. TCGA is a cancer dataset, not gene lists. So incorrect.

data_4: Source miRNet vs ProteomeXchange. Different databases. Incorrect.

data_5: All fields match except format. Groundtruth format is empty, anno has empty too (since in groundtruth it's empty? Wait, anno data_5's format is empty? Wait in groundtruth data_5's format is empty, and anno's data_5's format is also empty? Yes. So okay.

data_6: omics RNA-seq matches. Source is different (Gene Expression vs National Omics...). Since source is optional, no penalty. Public_id matches. So okay.

data_7 is missing, so not counted here.

Calculating accuracy deductions:

Each sub-object has 50/7 ≈7.14 points per sub-object. 

For data_1: all correct. Full points.

data_2: omics mismatch. Let's say this deducts half the points (3.57). 

data_3: source mismatch. Another 3.57 deduction.

data_4: source mismatch. Another 3.57.

data_5: correct. Full.

data_6: correct. Full.

Total deductions: (3.57*2) =7.14. So accuracy score: 50 -7.14≈42.86.

Wait, but data_2 and data_4's accuracy issues. Also data_3's source.

Wait, data_2's omics is a major error, so maybe more than half deduction. Suppose each key-value pair is part of the 7.14. There are multiple fields, but the key ones like omics and source are important. 

Alternatively, for accuracy, each sub-object's key-value pairs are evaluated. Let's break down each sub-object's accuracy:

data_1: All correct → 7.14

data_2: omics ("Genomics" vs "Homo sapiens genome") is a major error. Maybe deduct 50% of its points (3.57). Also, public_id and source are okay? Wait, data_2's public_id in groundtruth is GRCh38, and anno has same. Source is HISAT2, which matches. Only omics is wrong. So maybe 50% deduction.

data_3: source is wrong (TCGA vs MSigDB). Deduct 50%.

data_4: source wrong (ProteomeXchange vs miRNet). Deduct 50%.

data_5: okay.

data_6: okay.

data_7 isn't matched (since considered missing in accuracy since we're only counting matched ones).

Total deductions for accuracy: 3.57 (data2) + 3.57 (data3) + 3.57 (data4) = 10.71. So accuracy score: 50 -10.71=39.29.

Hmm, so total data score would be:

Structure:10

Completeness: approx 17.14 (after missing 4 subs)

Accuracy: 39.29

Total data: 10+17.14+39.29=66.43, roughly 66.4. Rounding to nearest whole number, maybe 66.

Wait, but let me recalculate completeness more precisely. The groundtruth has 7 data entries. The annotation has 7, but 4 are missing (data_2,3,4,7). So 4 missing → each missing is 40/7≈5.71. Total deduction 4*5.71≈22.86. So completeness is 40-22.86≈17.14.

Adding up: 10 +17.14+39.29≈66.43. Let's round to 66.

Now moving to **Analyses** section.

Groundtruth analyses has 7 entries (analysis_1 to analysis_7). The annotation has 3 (analysis_1,5,7). Wait, let me check:

Annotation's analyses array has three items: analysis_1, analysis_5, analysis_7. But analysis_5's analysis_name is "Proteomics", which may not be in groundtruth. Groundtruth's analyses include analysis_1 to analysis_7.

So first, structure: Each analysis has id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The sub-objects in analyses must have these keys. The annotation's analyses entries have these, so structure is okay (10 points).

Content completeness (40 points): Check each groundtruth analysis sub-object exists in the annotation.

Groundtruth analyses:

1. analysis_1: "Differential expression analysis", data [data_1]

2. analysis_2: "Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)", data [data_3]

3. analysis_3: "enrichment analysis", data [data_1,data_4]

4. analysis_4: "differential expression analysis", data [data_6]

5. analysis_5: "Principal component analysis (PCA)", data [data_6]

6. analysis_6: "GSEA", data [data_6]

7. analysis_7: "Differential expression analysis", data [data_5]

Annotation analyses:

analysis_1: same as groundtruth's analysis_1 (name and data_1). So present.

analysis_5: "Proteomics" with data_6. This doesn't match any in groundtruth. The closest might be analysis_5 (PCA), but name is different. So not a match.

analysis_7: "Differential expression analysis" with data_5. Matches groundtruth analysis_7 (same name and data). So this is present.

The others (analysis_2,3,4,5,6) are missing in the annotation.

So total missing analyses: 5 (analysis_2,3,4,5,6). Plus analysis_5 (proteomics) is an extra.

So for completeness: Groundtruth has 7 analyses. Annotation has 2 valid (analysis_1 and 7) plus an extra (analysis_5). So missing 5. Deduction per missing is 40/7≈5.71 per. 5 missing → 28.55 deduction. Completeness score:40-28.55≈11.45.

Additionally, the extra analysis (analysis_5) might deduct some. The note says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties". Let's say 1 point for each extra (only analysis_5 is extra). So total completeness deduction:28.55 +1=29.55. Score:40-29.55≈10.45. But maybe just stick to missing count first.

Now for **accuracy** (50 points) on analyses:

Only the matched analyses (analysis_1 and analysis_7) are considered. 

analysis_1: matches exactly (same name and data references). So full 50/7≈7.14 points.

analysis_7: same name and data, so also full.

Other analyses in groundtruth are missing, so their accuracy isn't scored. 

Total accuracy score: (2 *7.14)=14.28. But wait, accuracy is per matched sub-object. Each of the two matched gets full points. So total accuracy is 14.28? Wait, no. The total accuracy points (50) are distributed across the groundtruth's analyses. Since only 2 are present (out of 7), their accuracy is fully scored, but the remaining 5 are not. Wait, actually, the accuracy section says: "For sub-objects deemed semantically matched in the 'Content Completeness' section, deductions are applied based on discrepancies in key-value pair semantics".

So for each of the matched sub-objects (analysis_1 and analysis_7), their key-values must be accurate. 

Analysis_1: "Differential expression analysis", analysis_data [data_1]. All correct. So full points (7.14 each).

Analysis_7: same as groundtruth. So another 7.14.

Total accuracy: 2 *7.14=14.28. But total accuracy points are 50. Wait, I'm confused. Wait, the accuracy is 50 points total. The way it works is each groundtruth analysis sub-object's accuracy contributes to the 50. But if they are missing, you can't score them. So only the matched ones (analysis_1 and 7) contribute. Each of those is worth (50/7)*2≈14.28. But if they are fully correct, then they get their portion. The rest (5 missed) can't contribute. Thus, the maximum possible accuracy score here would be (2/7)*50≈14.28. Since they are fully correct, the accuracy is 14.28. 

Thus, total analyses score: structure 10 + completeness ~11.45 + accuracy ~14.28 ≈35.73. Approximately 36.

Moving to **Results** section.

Groundtruth results have 11 entries. Annotation has 7. 

Structure: Each result must have analysis_id, metrics, value, features. The optional fields (metrics, value) can be empty. Checking the annotation's results:

All entries have analysis_id, features. Some have metrics or value empty. The structure seems okay. So 10 points.

Content completeness (40 points): Check each groundtruth result entry is present in the annotation.

Groundtruth results:

1. analysis_id: analysis_2 → features ["significantly enriched pathways"]

2. analysis_1 → features ["NAAT+ve", etc.]

3. analysis_3 → features ["NAAT-ve", etc.]

4. analysis_1 → features ["684 DEGs", etc.]

5. analysis_1 → features ["IFN-γ", etc.]

6. analysis_1 → ["KREMEN1"]

7. analysis_1 → ["hsa-miR-...", etc.]

8. analysis_1 → ["KEGG", etc.]

9. analysis_4 → ["1,119 ..."]

10. analysis_6 → ["response to virus"]

11. analysis_7 → ["MX1", etc.]

Annotation results:

1. analysis_5 (which isn't in groundtruth's analyses, since analysis_5 in groundtruth is PCA but anno's analysis_5 is Proteomics). So this result is linked to an analysis not in groundtruth. Does this count? Since the analysis itself isn't present in groundtruth, the result might be invalid. But according to the scoring rules, if groundtruth lacks a section, don't score. Wait, but the results are tied to analyses. If the analysis isn't in groundtruth, then that result might be considered extra.

Let me list the annotation's results:

- analysis_5: features ["significantly enriched pathways"], metrics AUC. But analysis_5 in the analyses was a new one (Proteomics), not present in groundtruth. So this result is linked to an analysis not in groundtruth → considered extra.

- analysis_1 has two entries: metrics p, features IFN-γ, IL18, IL10; and another with KREMEN1. 

- analysis_6 has MAE and features hsa-miR..., etc.

- analysis_8: which isn't present in groundtruth's analyses (groundtruth has up to analysis_7). So analysis_8 is invalid, making this result extra.

- analysis_4 has "1,119..." 

- analysis_6 has "response to virus"

- analysis_8's features.

So let's see which groundtruth results are present:

Looking at groundtruth's results:

The annotation's results include:

- analysis_1's results: two entries (matching some of groundtruth's analysis_1's features). But groundtruth has multiple entries for analysis_1. For example, in groundtruth, analysis_1 has five results (entries 2,4,5,6,7,8?). Wait need to recount:

Groundtruth analysis_1 is linked to results entries 2,4,5,6,7,8. That's six entries. The annotation has two for analysis_1. Are those features covered?

The annotation's analysis_1 entries:

One has ["IFN-γ", "IL 18", "IL 10"] which matches part of groundtruth's entry 5 (which has those plus IL 10, TNF-α). Another has ["KREMEN1"], matching groundtruth entry6. So partially covered. However, the other features in groundtruth's analysis_1 results (like 684 DEGs, MX1, etc.) are missing in the annotation. So for analysis_1's results, there are multiple entries in groundtruth but only two in the annotation. Hence, incomplete.

Similarly, analysis_2's result (groundtruth entry1) is missing in the annotation. The annotation has none for analysis_2 since analysis_2 isn't present in their analyses.

analysis_3's result (entry3) is missing.

analysis_4's result (entry9) is present in the annotation (has one entry for analysis_4).

analysis_6's result (entry10) is present (annotation has it under analysis_6? Wait in the annotation's results, there's analysis_6 with features "response to virus". Groundtruth analysis_6's result is entry10. So that's present.

analysis_7's result (entry11) is in the annotation (the last entry has analysis_7's MX1, etc.? The annotation's last result is analysis_7 with ["MX1", "MX1-201"], which matches groundtruth's entry11. So that's present.

Other entries in groundtruth: analysis_3's result (entry3) and analysis_1's other features are missing.

So total missing results:

Groundtruth has 11 results. The annotation has 7, but some are extra or linked to non-existent analyses.

Breaking down:

Which groundtruth results are matched?

1. analysis_2: no → missing

2. analysis_1 (entry2): partially, but the features in annotation's analysis_1 entries don't fully capture all features listed. For example, the first analysis_1 result in anno has ["IFN-γ", "IL 18", "IL 10"], which are part of groundtruth's entry5 (which has more features). But does this count as a match? The instruction says to consider semantic equivalence. Since it's part of the features, maybe it's considered a partial match but incomplete. Or maybe each feature entry is a separate sub-object. Wait, each result entry is a sub-object. So each groundtruth result entry needs to be matched as a whole.

For instance, groundtruth result1 (analysis_2's entry) is missing. The annotation has no result for analysis_2.

Groundtruth's analysis_3 result is missing.

Groundtruth analysis_1 has six result entries. The anno has two for analysis_1. So four missing.

Groundtruth analysis_4 has one result (entry9), which is present in anno.

Groundtruth analysis_6 has one result (entry10), present in anno.

Groundtruth analysis_7 has one result (entry11), present.

So total missing results:

analysis_2 (1), analysis_3 (1), analysis_1 (4 entries), totaling 6 missing.

Plus the analysis_1's existing entries in anno may not fully cover, but each is a separate sub-object. So each of the missing sub-objects (6) would deduct points.

Number of groundtruth result sub-objects: 11. Each is worth 40/11≈3.64 points.

Missing 6 → 6*3.64≈21.84 deduction. So completeness:40-21.84≈18.16.

Also, the annotation has extra results: analysis_5 (linked to invalid analysis) and analysis_8 (nonexistent analysis). So two extra. Each might deduct 1 point, totaling 2. So completeness becomes 40 -21.84 -2≈16.16.

Now **Accuracy** (50 points):

Only the matched sub-objects (those that exist in both) are scored. Let's see:

Matched results:

analysis_4's result (entry9): in anno it's present with features ["1,119..."], which matches groundtruth's "1,119 differentially expressed genes". So accurate.

analysis_6's result (entry10): features "response to virus" matches exactly.

analysis_7's result (entry11): features match.

analysis_1's two entries in anno:

First: metrics "p", features ["IFN-γ", "IL 18", "IL 10"]. Groundtruth has in entry5: ["IFN-γ", "IL 18", "IL 10", "IL10", "TNF-α"]. Wait groundtruth's entry5 features are ["IFN-γ", "IL 18", "IL 10", "TNF-α"] (assuming typo in original data). The anno's features are subset but missing TNF-α. So incomplete features. 

Second: features ["KREMEN1"] matches groundtruth's entry6.

Additionally, the metrics in anno's analysis_1 entries are "p" whereas groundtruth has metrics empty. Since metrics is optional, this is acceptable. So the metrics are okay.

So for analysis_1's two entries:

First entry: missing some features (TNF-α), so accuracy deduction. 

Second is accurate.

analysis_4, analysis_6, analysis_7 are accurate.

Total matched sub-objects:

analysis_1 (2 entries), analysis_4 (1), analysis_6 (1), analysis_7 (1). Total 5 matched.

Each of these has an accuracy score. Let's see:

analysis_4: accurate → full points (50/11≈4.55 each?)

Wait the accuracy points are allocated over the groundtruth's sub-objects. Each of the 11 groundtruth sub-objects has 50/11≈4.545 points.

For each matched sub-object, check accuracy:

analysis_4's result: accurate → 4.545.

analysis_6's result: accurate → 4.545.

analysis_7's result: accurate →4.545.

analysis_1's first entry: features are incomplete (missing TNF-α). So partial. Maybe deduct half →2.27.

analysis_1's second entry: accurate →4.545.

Total accuracy points:

4.545 *3 (accurate) +2.27 +4.545 (second entry) =

Wait:

analysis_1 first entry: 2.27 (half)

second entry:4.545

analysis_4:4.545

analysis_6:4.545

analysis_7:4.545

Total: 2.27 +4.545 +4.545*3 = 

2.27 +4.545 =6.815

+4.545*3=13.635 → total 6.815 +13.635 =20.45.

The other matched sub-objects (analysis_1's second and others) add up to this.

Additionally, any other deductions?

analysis_1's first entry missed a feature, so that's a deduction. 

analysis_5's result (extra) isn't counted.

analysis_8's result is invalid.

Total accuracy score: ~20.45. 

Thus, results score:

Structure:10 +

Completeness ~16.16 +

Accuracy ~20.45 → total ≈46.61.

Putting all together:

Data: ~66.43

Analyses: ~35.73

Results: ~46.61

Final scores rounded to nearest integer:

Data: 66

Analyses:36

Results:47

But let me double-check calculations for accuracy in results:

Each of the 5 matched sub-objects (analysis_1 two entries, analysis_4,6,7) contribute their portions. The inaccuracies were in analysis_1's first entry's features. The missing TNF-α could be a minor issue. If that's considered a full deduction for that sub-object, then analysis_1 first entry gets zero. Then total would be:

analysis_1 first:0,

second:4.545,

others 4.545*4 → total 4.545*5=22.725.

Wait, maybe my earlier calculation was off. Let me recalculate:

If analysis_1's first entry is partially accurate (missing a feature), maybe it's 75% accuracy (since 3 out of 4 features?), but this is getting too granular. The instruction says prioritize semantic alignment. If the missing TNF-α is critical, then it's a major error. Alternatively, since the features are a list, having most is okay. This is ambiguous.

Alternatively, treating analysis_1's first entry as a full match since it has some features but not all. The groundtruth's entry has more, but the anno's is a subset. Depending on whether subsets are acceptable. Since the key is semantic equivalence, maybe it's considered a match but with some inaccuracy. 

This is quite subjective. To simplify, maybe assume that each matched sub-object either gets full points or none based on major discrepancies. 

Alternatively, since the features are lists, if the anno's features are a subset, it's still mostly accurate. So maybe full points. 

If that's the case, analysis_1's first entry would get full points. Then total accuracy:

analysis_1: 2 entries *4.545 =9.09,

analysis_4:4.545,

analysis_6:4.545,

analysis_7:4.545.

Total: 9.09 + 4.545*3=9.09+13.635=22.725.

That brings the accuracy to ~22.73, making results total 10+16.16+22.73≈48.89≈49.

Perhaps the scorer would round differently, but to keep it manageable:

Final scores:

Data: ~66

Analyses: ~36

Results: ~47-49 → say 48.

So the final output would be:

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 66,
    "Analyses": 36,
    "Results": 48
}

Wait, but maybe I made an error in analyses' completeness. Let me recheck:

Analyses completeness:

Groundtruth has 7 analyses, anno has 3. But only 2 (analysis_1 and 7) are matches. So missing 5. Each missing is 40/7≈5.71. 5*5.71≈28.55. So completeness is 40-28.55≈11.45. Plus 1 for extra analysis_5: total deduction 29.55 → 10.45. Rounded to 11.

Thus analyses total:10 +11 +14.28≈35.28≈35.

Hmm, but earlier I had 36. Close enough.

Alternatively, if the extra analysis is not penalized, then 10 +11.45 +14.28≈35.73≈36.

Probably safe to put 36.

So final scores as above.
