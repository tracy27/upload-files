Okay, I need to score the annotation result based on the groundtruth provided. Let me start by understanding the task requirements again. The user wants me to evaluate three main components: data, analyses, and results. Each component gets a separate score out of 100, considering structure, content completeness (40 points), and content accuracy (50 points). 

First, I'll tackle the "data" section. The structure is worth 10 points. Looking at the groundtruth, the data array has four entries, each with id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. The annotation result has two data entries. Let me check if the structure matches. Both have the required keys. The optional fields like link, format, public_id might be missing but that's okay since they're optional. So structure looks good here. I'll give full 10 points for structure.

Next, content completeness (40 points). Groundtruth has four data sub-objects. The annotation has two. So it's missing data_1 and data_2. Each missing sub-object would deduct points. Since there are two missing, maybe 20 points off? Wait, the total completeness is 40, so each sub-object is worth 40 divided by number of groundtruth sub-objects. Wait, actually, the instructions say to deduct points for missing sub-objects. But how much per missing? Since there are four in groundtruth, each missing one would be 40/4 = 10 points each. So missing two would deduct 20. But also, the annotation has extra sub-objects? No, because they have exactly two which are present in groundtruth (data_3 and data_4). Wait, wait, looking again:

Groundtruth data includes data_1 (clinical data), data_2 (SOMAScan proteomics), data_3 (RNA-Seq), data_4 (Metabolon). The annotation has data_3 and data_4. So missing data_1 and data_2. Each missing is -10, so total 20 points lost here. Thus completeness score would be 20 points (since 40-20=20). Wait, no, total possible is 40. If they missed two, then 40*(2/4)=20 deduction? Or per missing? Let me re-read: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object". Since there are 4 in groundtruth, each missing one subtracts (40/4)=10 points. So missing two would be 20 points off. So content completeness would be 40 -20=20? That seems harsh, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps each missing sub-object is a proportional penalty. Let me confirm the exact instruction: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object". It doesn't specify per-subobject, but maybe per missing. So if there are N sub-objects in groundtruth, each missing one reduces the completeness by (40/N). Here N=4, so each missing is 10. So yes, 20 points lost here. So content completeness score is 20.

Now content accuracy (50 points). For the existing sub-objects (data_3 and data_4), check if their key-value pairs match. Let's look at data_3 first. In groundtruth: omics is RNA-Seq data, link is ncbi/gap, source dbGaP, public_id phs000765... The annotation's data_3 has same values. Similarly data_4: omics Metabolon data, link to metabolomicsworkbench, source Metabolomics Workbench, public_id PR000907. The annotation's public_id has a space before PR000907? In groundtruth it's " PR000907" (with leading space?), but maybe that's a typo. Wait, looking back: Groundtruth for data_4's public_id is " PR000907" (space before), whereas the annotation's public_id is " PR000907"? Wait, checking the input: 

Groundtruth data_4's public_id: "public_id": " PR000907" (has space before). The annotation has "public_id": " PR000907" — same. So that's accurate. All other fields for data_3 and 4 are correct. The optional fields like link and format are empty, which is okay. So both sub-objects have perfect accuracy. So 50 points here. Total data score: 10 +20+50=80?

Wait, hold on. Wait, content accuracy is per matched sub-object. The two sub-objects (data_3 and data_4) are present and correct. So for each of them, all their key-value pairs are correct except maybe public_id's leading space. Hmm, but the problem says to consider semantic equivalence. The space might be a formatting error, but semantically same. So probably no deduction here. So accuracy is 50. So data total is 10+20+50=80.

Moving to "analyses" section. Structure (10 points). Groundtruth analyses have 10 entries, each with id, analysis_name, analysis_data (which can be a string or array). The annotation's analyses have 5 entries. Let me check their structure. Each analysis in the annotation has id, analysis_name, analysis_data, and possibly label (if included). The groundtruth has some with labels, but in the annotation, the ones present don't have labels unless specified. The structure seems okay. For example, analysis_1 has analysis_data as "data_2", which is a string. Others like analysis_4 has array. The structure is correct. So structure score 10.

Content completeness (40 points). Groundtruth has 10 analyses. The annotation has 5. So missing 5 sub-objects. Each missing would be 40/10=4 points each. So 5*4=20 points deducted, resulting in 20. Wait, but let's list them:

Groundtruth analyses:
analysis_1 (Proteomics)
analysis_2 (Transcriptomics)
analysis_3 (Metabolomic)
analysis_4 (covariate filtering)
analysis_5 (PCA analysis)
analysis_6 (another PCA)
analysis_7 (auto encoders)
analysis_8 (Clustering)
analysis_9 (Clinical associations)
analysis_10 (Feature Selection)

Annotation's analyses:
analysis_1, analysis_3, analysis_4, analysis_5, analysis_8.

Missing are analysis_2, analysis_6, analysis_7, analysis_9, analysis_10. So 5 missing. So 5*4=20, so content completeness is 40-20=20.

Content accuracy (50 points). Now, for the present analyses:

Analysis_1: in groundtruth, analysis_data is "data_2". In annotation, it's also "data_2". Correct. Analysis_name matches.

Analysis_3 (Metabolomic): analysis_data is data_4, which matches groundtruth.

Analysis_4 (covariate filtering): analysis_data in groundtruth is [analysis_1, analysis_2, analysis_3]. In the annotation, it's [analysis_1, analysis_2, analysis_3]. Wait, but in the annotation's analysis_4's analysis_data, does it include analysis_2? Wait, the annotation's analysis array has analysis_4's analysis_data as ["analysis_1","analysis_2","analysis_3"]. But in the annotation's analyses, does analysis_2 exist? Wait, in the annotation's analyses list, the analyses present are analysis_1, analysis_3 (metabolomic), analysis_4, analysis_5, analysis_8. So analysis_2 is missing. Wait, the analysis_4 in the annotation refers to analysis_2 which isn't present in the annotation. But according to the rules, we compare against groundtruth's structure. Wait, the analysis_data references should point to existing sub-objects in the annotation? Or just check if the links are correctly pointing to the groundtruth's structure? Hmm, this is tricky. The analysis_data in the groundtruth's analysis_4 uses analysis_2, but in the annotation, analysis_2 isn't present. So when the annotation's analysis_4 references analysis_2, which is missing in their own analyses, that might be an error. Because in the annotation's context, analysis_2 doesn't exist, so the link is invalid. But according to the task's note: "data_id or analysis_id are only unique identifiers... scoring should focus on the sub-objects content, rather than using IDs to assess consistency". Wait, but analysis_data is pointing to another analysis's id. Since analysis_2 is not present in the annotation's analyses, this is an error. So that's a problem in the content accuracy. 

Alternatively, maybe the analysis_data refers to the original groundtruth's analysis_2, but since it's missing in the annotation, the reference is invalid. So in the annotation's analysis_4, the analysis_data includes analysis_2, which isn't present in their own analyses, so that's an incorrect link. Hence, this would lead to a deduction. 

Similarly, analysis_5 (PCA analysis) in the groundtruth points to analysis_4, which exists in the annotation. So that's correct. 

Analysis_8 (Clustering) in groundtruth's analysis_8 has analysis_data as analysis_7. But in the annotation's analysis_8, the analysis_data is analysis_7, which is not present in the annotation's analyses (since analysis_7 is missing). So that's another error. 

Therefore, looking at each existing analysis in the annotation:

Analysis_1: correct.

Analysis_3: correct.

Analysis_4: The analysis_data includes analysis_2 (missing in annotation) and analysis_3 (exists). Wait, analysis_3 is present. So the analysis_2 part is wrong. Since analysis_2 is missing in the annotation, this link is broken. So this analysis's analysis_data is partially correct but has a missing dependency. Since the analysis_2 is missing, this is an error here. So this analysis's analysis_data is incorrect.

Analysis_5: correct, because analysis_4 is present.

Analysis_8: analysis_data is ["analysis_7"], but analysis_7 is not present in the annotation, so this is incorrect.

So for the five analyses in the annotation, three have issues:

Analysis_4 has an invalid reference (analysis_2).

Analysis_8 has invalid reference (analysis_7).

Analysis_5 is okay.

Analysis_1 and 3 are okay.

Wait, analysis_4 in the annotation's analysis_data has ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "analysis_3"]. Since analysis_2 is missing, but analysis_1 and 3 are present, so part of it is correct. However, since analysis_2 is missing in the annotation, the entire analysis_data is invalid because it's referencing something not present. Depending on whether partial correctness is allowed, but since the reference is to an absent analysis, that's an error. 

Similarly analysis_8's data is analysis_7 which is missing. So two of the five analyses have errors in their analysis_data fields. 

Additionally, analysis_10 is missing entirely, so its features aren't captured here. But we are only evaluating the existing sub-objects. 

Calculating accuracy points: Each of the five analyses in the annotation contributes to the accuracy. 

Each analysis's accuracy is checked. 

Analysis_1: full accuracy (10 points each? Or per key?)

Wait, content accuracy for analyses: For each matched sub-object (those present in both groundtruth and annotation), check all key-value pairs. 

The analyses in the annotation that are present in groundtruth are:

analysis_1, analysis_3, analysis_4, analysis_5, analysis_8.

Comparing each to their groundtruth counterparts:

1. analysis_1:

Groundtruth: analysis_data is "data_2". Annotation has analysis_data as "data_2" → correct. analysis_name matches. So this is accurate. 

2. analysis_3 (groundtruth's analysis_3):

analysis_data is data_4 → matches. Name "Metabolomic" is same. So accurate.

3. analysis_4 (groundtruth's analysis_4):

In groundtruth, analysis_data is [analysis_1, analysis_2, analysis_3]. 

In annotation's analysis_4, analysis_data is [analysis_1, analysis_2, analysis_3]. 

However, in the annotation's analyses, analysis_2 is missing. So even though the analysis_data array in the annotation's analysis_4 is correct according to groundtruth's structure, the fact that analysis_2 is missing in the annotation's analyses makes this reference invalid. 

Wait, but according to the problem statement: "When the same sub-objects are ordered differently, their IDs may vary. Therefore, scoring should focus on the sub-objects content, rather than using IDs to assess consistency." 

Hmm, perhaps the IDs themselves are not important as long as the content matches. Wait, but analysis_data points to an analysis's ID which may not exist in the annotation. 

Alternatively, maybe the analysis_data field is supposed to reference existing analyses in the current document. Since analysis_2 is missing, the reference is invalid. Therefore, the analysis_data entry in analysis_4 is incorrect. 

Thus, analysis_4's analysis_data is partially correct but has an invalid reference. Since one of the IDs is missing, this leads to an error here. 

4. analysis_5 (groundtruth's analysis_5):

analysis_data is [analysis_4], which in the annotation is present. So correct. 

5. analysis_8 (groundtruth's analysis_8):

analysis_data is [analysis_7]. In the annotation's analysis_8, it's also [analysis_7], but analysis_7 is missing in the annotation's analyses. So this is invalid. 

So among the five analyses in the annotation:

- analysis_1: 100% accurate (all keys correct)
- analysis_3: 100%
- analysis_4: analysis_data is incorrect (due to analysis_2 missing), so maybe half points?
- analysis_5: 100%
- analysis_8: analysis_data is incorrect (analysis_7 missing), so maybe 0?

Alternatively, each analysis's accuracy is considered as a whole. For analysis_4, since the analysis_data includes an invalid reference, it's incorrect. So this analysis's accuracy is 0? Or partial?

Assuming each analysis is scored individually for their key-value pairs. The keys for an analysis are analysis_name, analysis_data, and any others like label (which is optional).

For analysis_4:

analysis_name: correct (covariate filtering)

analysis_data: has three elements, one of which (analysis_2) is missing in the annotation. Since the reference is to an analysis that isn't present, this is incorrect. 

Thus, analysis_data is incorrect. Since analysis_data is a critical part, this analysis's accuracy is 0? Or maybe 1/2? Because name is correct but data is wrong. 

Same for analysis_8: name is correct ("Clustering analysis"), analysis_data is [analysis_7] which is missing. So data is wrong. 

Assuming that for each analysis, if any key is wrong, it's a failure. Since analysis_data is part of the required keys, this would mean analysis_4 and 8 are inaccurate. 

Thus, out of the 5 analyses in the annotation:

- 3 are fully correct (analysis_1,3,5)
- 2 have errors (analysis_4,8)

Total accuracy points: Each analysis contributes equally towards the 50 points. Since there are 5 analyses in the annotation, each is worth 10 points (50/5=10 per analysis). 

Analysis_1: +10

Analysis_3:+10

Analysis_4: 0 (because analysis_data is wrong)

Analysis_5:+10

Analysis_8: 0 

Total accuracy score: 10+10+0+10+0 =30. 

So content accuracy is 30 points. 

Therefore, total analyses score: structure 10 + completeness 20 + accuracy 30 =60.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. The content accuracy is for the sub-objects that are present and matched. The total possible is 50 points. If there are 5 sub-objects, each is worth 10. So if two have 0, that's 30. So yes, 30.

Now moving to "results" section. 

Structure (10 points). The groundtruth has one result entry with analysis_id, features, metrics, value. The annotation also has one result. Let's see the structure:

Groundtruth's result has analysis_id (analysis_10), features array, metrics "F1 score", and value array. 

Annotation's result has analysis_id (analysis_10), features array, metrics "F1 score", and value array. So structure is correct. The keys are present. Even though the analysis_10 is missing in the analyses section, but the structure itself is okay. So structure score 10.

Content completeness (40 points). The groundtruth has one result. The annotation has one. So no missing, so 40 points. 

But wait, the problem states: "If the ground truth has missing sections and the annotation result includes those sections, skip scoring for those parts." Here, groundtruth has results, so we score. Since the count is same (1 vs 1), no deduction. So completeness is 40.

Content accuracy (50 points). Need to check if the result's key-value pairs match. 

The analysis_id in groundtruth is "analysis_10". In the annotation, it's also "analysis_10". So correct. 

Features array: comparing the lists. The groundtruth's features list has a lot of items, and the annotation's list is almost the same except maybe some entries? Let me check:

Looking at the features arrays. The groundtruth has 61 entries (from the JSON given). The annotation's features array is shorter? Wait, in the input given:

Groundtruth results.features has 61 items (counted roughly). The annotation's features array has 61 items as well? Let me check the lengths. 

Groundtruth features:
The list starts with SLCO4C1 up to UQCRB. Counting commas: let's see, in groundtruth's features, the last item is "UQCRB", so entries separated by commas. The exact count might be tedious, but assuming they are same length. 

The values in the features and metrics/value need to match. The metrics is "F1 score" in both. 

Looking for differences:

In groundtruth, the features list includes "X\u2013 12117", but in the annotation's features, it's written as "X\u2013 12117" as well? Or maybe a typo? Let me check the exact text:

Groundtruth features has "X\u2013 12117" (the \u2013 is en dash?), and the annotation's features have the same. 

Another possible discrepancy: in the groundtruth's public_id for data_4 is " PR000907" (with space), but that's part of data, not results. 

Looking at the metrics and values: both have "F1 score" and the value arrays are the same. So features and values are identical?

Wait, let me compare the features list between groundtruth and annotation's results. 

In groundtruth's features array:

... "X\u2013 12117", "stearoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0)", ... 

In the annotation's features array, the same entries are present. 

Looking further down:

Groundtruth's features ends with "UQCRB", same as the annotation. 

Assuming the features and value arrays are exactly the same. So metrics and value are correct. 

Thus, all key-value pairs are accurate. The analysis_id refers to analysis_10 which is missing in the analyses section, but the structure of the result is correct. However, the analysis_10 is not present in the analyses of the annotation. Does this affect the accuracy?

The problem says: "content accuracy evaluates the accuracy of matched sub-object’s key-value pairs". The analysis_id in the result is pointing to an analysis that doesn't exist in the annotation's analyses. This could be an issue because in the context of the annotation, analysis_10 isn't there, making the reference invalid. 

This is similar to the analyses section's problem. The analysis_id in the result must correspond to an analysis in the annotation's analyses. Since analysis_10 is missing, this is an error. 

Therefore, the analysis_id field is incorrect. 

So the key "analysis_id" has the wrong value because the analysis_10 isn't present. 

This would mean the analysis_id is incorrect. Since analysis_id is a key in the result, its value must refer to a valid analysis in the annotation. Since it's pointing to analysis_10 which is missing, this is an error. 

Thus, the analysis_id is wrong. 

What about other keys: metrics and value are correct. features are correct. Only analysis_id is wrong. 

How much does that affect the accuracy? 

The analysis_id is a key that must correctly reference an existing analysis. Since it's incorrect, that's a significant error. 

Assuming that analysis_id is a critical key, its inaccuracy would result in a deduction. Since this is one key out of the four (analysis_id, features, metrics, value), maybe 25% deduction (since 50 points total for accuracy). 

Alternatively, the analysis_id being incorrect might nullify the accuracy. 

Let me think: the result's analysis_id refers to analysis_10, which is not present in the analyses section of the annotation. Therefore, this is an invalid reference. 

This would make the analysis_id incorrect. Since analysis_id is a required field, this is a major mistake. 

Thus, the content accuracy for the results would lose points here. 

Assuming that analysis_id is 25% of the accuracy (since four keys?), but actually the keys are:

The result has analysis_id (required?), features (array), metrics (optional?), value (optional?). 

Wait, according to the problem statement, for results, the optional fields are "metric and value are optional". So analysis_id is required, features is required, metrics and value are optional. 

The analysis_id is required and must correctly point to an analysis in the analyses section. 

Since analysis_10 is missing in the analyses, the analysis_id is incorrect. 

Thus, this key is wrong, which is a significant error. 

The features and metrics/values are correct. 

So for the result's accuracy: 

analysis_id: incorrect (invalid reference) → - some points.

features: correct → full.

metrics: correct.

value: correct.

Assuming analysis_id is crucial, perhaps this halves the score. 

If the total accuracy is 50, and analysis_id is wrong but others are right, maybe 25 points. 

Alternatively, since analysis_id is a key that must be valid, it might be a full deduction. 

Alternatively, maybe the presence of analysis_10 in the result when it's not in analyses is a severe error. 

I think this would result in a 50% deduction here. 

So content accuracy score: 25. 

Thus, total results score: 10 (structure) +40 (completeness) +25 (accuracy) =75.

Wait, but let me reassess. 

The analysis_id is pointing to an analysis that's not present. Since the analysis isn't there, the result's analysis_id is invalid. 

This is a key inaccuracy. How many points would that cost?

The content accuracy is 50 points for the sub-object. If the analysis_id is incorrect, but the rest (features, metrics, value) are correct, perhaps we lose 25 points (half). 

Alternatively, if the analysis_id is required and wrong, maybe 50% of the accuracy (25 points) is deducted. 

Alternatively, since analysis_id is a direct link, it's a major part. Suppose the analysis_id contributes significantly to the accuracy. Maybe 50% of the points (25 points) are lost here. 

Thus, content accuracy would be 25. 

Total results score: 10+40+25=75.

Putting it all together:

Data: 10+20+50=80

Analyses:10+20+30=60

Results:10+40+25=75

Wait, but let me verify the calculations again.

For analyses' content accuracy: 5 analyses in the annotation. Each worth 10 points (total 50). 

analysis_1: correct → +10

analysis_3: correct → +10

analysis_4: analysis_data has invalid references → 0 

analysis_5: correct → +10

analysis_8: analysis_data invalid →0 

Total accuracy points: 30. 

Yes. 

Analyses total: 10+20+30=60.

Results' content accuracy: The result has analysis_id wrong (invalid), but other parts correct. Suppose analysis_id is critical, so this is a major flaw. If the analysis_id is incorrect, the entire result is invalid? Or only that key is wrong. 

Alternatively, since the features and value are correct but the analysis_id is wrong, perhaps 50% deduction. 

So 25 points for accuracy. 

Thus, Final Scores: Data 80, Analyses 60, Results 75. 

Wait, but the user said to use the format:

"Final Scores": {

 "Data":,

 "Analyses":,

 "Results":

}

So I need to output that. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the results' analysis_id. Let me check the annotation's analyses again. The analyses in the annotation do NOT have analysis_10. The result in the annotation references analysis_10, which is not present. So this is definitely an error. 

Hence, the analysis_id is incorrect. 

Therefore, the result's key analysis_id is wrong, so that key is incorrect. The features and value are correct. 

The analysis_id is a required key, so this is a critical error. 

Perhaps the accuracy for the results is 25 (since half the points lost due to this error). 

Alternatively, if analysis_id is 20% of the accuracy (assuming four keys: analysis_id, features, metrics, value), then losing 20% of 50 is 10 points. But metrics and value are optional. 

The required keys in results are analysis_id and features. 

So analysis_id and features are required. 

If analysis_id is wrong but features are correct, then maybe:

analysis_id: incorrect → -25 points (since it's 50 total for accuracy, and analysis_id is half the required keys?)

Or, the analysis_id being incorrect means that the entire sub-object is invalid, so 0 points? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, each key's weight. Since features are an array with many entries, perhaps they contribute more. 

Alternatively, the analysis_id is a single key, so losing a portion. 

Suppose that analysis_id is 20% of the accuracy (since two required keys: analysis_id and features). If analysis_id is wrong but features are correct, then 80% of the accuracy. 

So 50 *0.8=40. 

Wait, this is getting too ambiguous. To resolve quickly, maybe assume that analysis_id is required and incorrect, so 50% deduction: 25 points. 

Therefore, results accuracy is 25. 

So the final scores would be:

Data: 80

Analyses: 60

Results: 75 (10+40+25)

But wait, let me recalculate the results:

Structure 10, completeness 40 (since they have 1/1 correct count), accuracy 25. Total 75. 

Yes. 

So the final scores should be:

"Data": 80,

"Analyses":60,

"Results":75

But let me check for any other possible deductions.

In the results, the features array must exactly match? Are there any discrepancies?

Looking at the features array in groundtruth and annotation:

The groundtruth's features array includes "X\u2013 12117" (with \u2013 being an en dash), and the annotation's features also have the same. 

Another entry: "stearoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0)" versus "stearoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0)" — same.

All other entries seem to match. 

Metrics and value are same. 

Only analysis_id is wrong. 

Thus, yes, the deduction is accurate. 

Therefore, the final scores are as above.

    "Final Scores": {

### Scoring Process Explanation:

#### **Data Section (Score: 80/100)**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  The annotation's `data` structure matches the groundtruth's JSON structure with correct key-value pairs (`id`, `omics`, `link`, etc.). Optional fields like `format` and `public_id` are handled appropriately.

- **Content Completeness (20/40):**  
  The groundtruth has **4** `data` sub-objects, but the annotation only includes **2** (`data_3` and `data_4`). Missing sub-objects (`data_1` and `data_2`) result in a deduction of **20 points** (40 – (2 missing × 10 points each)).

- **Content Accuracy (50/50):**  
  Both included sub-objects (`data_3` and `data_4`) have accurate key-value pairs. Minor formatting differences (e.g., trailing space in `public_id`) are ignored as they are semantically equivalent.

---

#### **Analyses Section (Score: 60/100)**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  The `analyses` structure aligns with the groundtruth, including nested arrays for `analysis_data`. Required keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`) are present.

- **Content Completeness (20/40):**  
  The groundtruth has **10** `analyses` sub-objects, but the annotation only includes **5**. Missing sub-objects (`analysis_2`, `analysis_6`, `analysis_7`, `analysis_9`, `analysis_10`) result in a deduction of **20 points** (40 – (5 missing × 4 points each)).

- **Content Accuracy (30/50):**  
  Of the **5** included analyses:
  - **3** are fully accurate (`analysis_1`, `analysis_3`, `analysis_5`).  
  - **2** have critical errors:  
    - `analysis_4` references missing `analysis_2`.  
    - `analysis_8` references missing `analysis_7`.  
  Each analysis contributes **10 points**, totaling **30/50**.

---

#### **Results Section (Score: 75/100)**
- **Structure (10/10):**  
  The `results` structure matches the groundtruth, with `analysis_id`, `features`, `metrics`, and `value`.

- **Content Completeness (40/40):**  
  Both groundtruth and annotation include **1** `results` sub-object. No deductions applied.

- **Content Accuracy (25/50):**  
  The `analysis_id` (`analysis_10`) references a missing analysis in the annotation, making it invalid. However, `features`, `metrics`, and `value` are accurate. This error deducts **25 points** (50 – 25).  

---

### Summary:
- **Data**: Missed 2 sub-objects but scored perfectly on accuracy.  
- **Analyses**: Missed 5 sub-objects and had invalid references.  
- **Results**: Critical reference error reduced accuracy but otherwise precise.
