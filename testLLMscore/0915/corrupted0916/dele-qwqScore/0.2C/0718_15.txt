Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

Starting with the Data section:

Groundtruth has 6 data entries (data_1 to data_6). The annotation result lists 3 data entries. Comparing them:

- data_1: matches exactly.
- data_3: present in both, so okay.
- data_5: matches exactly.

Missing in the annotation result are data_2, data_4, and data_6. That's 3 missing sub-objects. Each missing one would deduct points from content completeness. Since there are 6 total in groundtruth, missing 3 would be half, but since content completeness is 40 points, maybe 40*(3/6) = 20 deduction? Wait, the instruction says deduct points for missing any sub-object. So each missing sub-object is a penalty. The exact point deduction isn't specified, but perhaps per sub-object? Since the maximum is 40, maybe each missing sub-object is (40/6)*number missing? Hmm, need to think.

Alternatively, maybe each sub-object is worth (40 divided by the total number in groundtruth). Groundtruth has 6 data entries, so each is worth about 6.666 points. Missing 3 would lose 3*6.666 ≈ 20 points. So content completeness would be 40 - 20 = 20? But that seems harsh. Alternatively, maybe the deduction is proportional. Maybe the completeness score is (number present / total) *40. Here, present are 3 out of 6, so 3/6=0.5 → 20 points. That seems possible.

Structure: Check if each data entry has the correct keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). In the annotation result's data entries, all required keys seem present except for data_3 in groundtruth vs annotation? Wait no, looking at the input:

Looking at the annotation data:

For example, data_3 in the annotation has all the keys. Similarly, data_5 is okay. So structure looks good. So structure score 10/10.

Content accuracy for existing data entries: Need to check if their values match. For data_1, data_3, and data_5, their omics, links, sources, etc., all match exactly. So accuracy is full marks here. So 50 points for accuracy.

So Data total: Structure (10) + Completeness (20) + Accuracy (50) = 80? Wait, but let me confirm again.

Wait, the content completeness is 40 points. If the user missed 3 sub-objects, each missing would deduct (40/6)≈6.66 points each. So 3*6.66≈20 points off, resulting in 20. So 20 for completeness. Then accuracy for the existing ones is 50. So total 10+20+50=80? Or maybe the accuracy part is 50*(number correct/total). Wait no, accuracy is for matched sub-objects. Since all existing entries are correct, so accuracy is full 50. Yes, so 80 total?

Wait, but maybe the structure is 10, content completeness is 20, and content accuracy 50, totaling 80. That's plausible.

Now moving to Analyses:

Groundtruth has 17 analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_17). Annotation has 13 analyses (analysis_1,2,3,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17). Missing analyses are analysis_4,5,8, which are 4 missing. Additionally, some analyses might have incorrect content even if present.

First, checking completeness: 13 present out of 17. So 4 missing. Each missing analysis is a sub-object, so deduct (4/17)*40. Wait, same approach as before. Each sub-object (analysis) is worth (40/17)≈2.35 points. So missing 4 would deduct ~9.4 points. So completeness would be 40 -9.4≈30.6 → ~31.

But maybe the instruction says to deduct points for each missing sub-object. Since the instruction says "deduct points for missing any sub-object". It might be better to see each missing sub-object as a fixed deduction. Since it's unclear, perhaps the standard is per missing sub-object, deduct (40/(total groundtruth sub-objects)) per missing. For 17 total analyses, each missing is 40/17 ≈2.35. So 4 missing would be 4*2.35≈9.4. So 30.6 for completeness.

Next, structure: check each analysis entry. The keys like id, analysis_name, analysis_data, label, training_set etc. must follow the structure. Let me check:

In the annotation's analyses, each has the correct keys. For example, analysis_1 has analysis_data, analysis_2 has label, analysis_3 has training_set. The structure seems okay except maybe for analysis_13 which uses "data" instead of "analysis_data"? Looking at groundtruth's analysis_13: it's {"id": "analysis_13", "analysis_name": "TME", "data": ["data_5"]}. The groundtruth actually uses "data" there, so the annotation matches that. So structure is okay. So structure score 10.

Accuracy: Now, for the existing analyses, check if their key-value pairs are accurate. Let's go through each:

Analysis_1: matches exactly.

Analysis_2: matches.

Analysis_3: matches.

Analysis_6: in groundtruth, analysis_6 is univariate Cox regression with training_set: ["data_4", "analysis_5"], label: {"prognostic risk scores": ["High risk", "Low risk"]}. In annotation's analysis_6, it's the same except the analysis name is "univariate Cox regression", training_set includes "data_4" and "analysis_5", labels match. So accurate.

Analysis_7: matches.

Analysis_9: same as groundtruth's analysis_9 (Differential Analysis on data_4 with label "").

Analysis_10: matches.

Analysis_11: matches.

Analysis_12: matches.

Analysis_13: matches (using "data" key, which is correct).

Analysis_14: matches.

Analysis_16: matches.

Analysis_17: matches.

However, check analysis_6 in the annotation. The analysis_data in groundtruth for analysis_6 is ["data_4", "analysis_5"], and the annotation has ["data_4","analysis_5"], so correct.

Wait, but looking at the analyses in the annotation, analysis_4,5,8 are missing. Let me see:

The groundtruth has analysis_4 (Functional Enrichment Analysis of analysis_2), analysis_5 (Survival Analysis on data_4), analysis_8 (another univariate Cox regression on data_4 and analysis_5). These are missing in the annotation, hence contributing to the completeness deduction.

For accuracy, the existing analyses are all correct except maybe some details?

Wait, analysis_4 in the groundtruth is "Functional Enrichment Analysis" based on analysis_2. Since analysis_4 is missing in the annotation, it doesn't affect accuracy here. Only existing ones are considered. Since all present analyses have correct keys and values (except maybe minor typos?), like in analysis_4 of groundtruth, but it's missing in annotation. 

Wait, another thing: in analysis_17, the label's "Copy Number" entries in the groundtruth and annotation match exactly. So accuracy is okay. 

Thus, content accuracy for existing analyses is full 50. 

Total for Analyses: 10 (structure) + ~30.6 (completeness) +50 (accuracy). But since we can't have fractions, maybe round to nearest whole numbers. 30.6 ≈31, so total 91? Wait wait, 10+30.6+50=90.6≈91? But maybe the completeness was calculated differently. Let me recheck.

Wait, the groundtruth has 17 analyses, and the annotation has 13. So missing 4. Each missing is (40/17)*4 ≈9.4. Thus, completeness is 40-9.4=30.6. So total Analyses score would be 10+30.6+50=90.6, rounded to 91. But maybe the system expects integer points without fractions. Alternatively, maybe each missing sub-object deducts a set amount. Suppose each missing analysis deducts 40/17≈2.35, so total deduction 9.4, leading to 30.6 completeness. So total 10+30.6+50=90.6, so 91. However, perhaps the scorer rounds to whole numbers, so 91.

Wait, but maybe the instructions say to deduct per missing sub-object, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the content completeness is marked as follows: the user's sub-objects must include all from the groundtruth; each missing one loses (40 / total_groundtruth_subobjects) per missing. So yes, that's what I did.

Now Results section:

Groundtruth has 17 results entries (analysis_id from 1 to 10, plus others up to analysis_16?), wait let me count:

Looking at the groundtruth results array, there are 16 items (from analysis_1 to analysis_10 and analysis_15,16 etc.). Wait:

The groundtruth results array has 16 entries:

analysis_1 (two entries), analysis_2 (two), analysis_3 (two), analysis_4 (one), analysis_5 (two), analysis_6 (five), analysis_7 (one), analysis_8 (three), analysis_10 (one). Total: 2+2+2+1+2+5+1+3+1= 17? Wait let me recount:

Looking at the groundtruth results array:

1. analysis_1 (metrics correlation coefficient)

2. analysis_1 (metrics p)

3. analysis_2 (AUC)

4. analysis_2 (95% CI)

15. analysis_7 (AUC)

16. analysis_8 (1y OS)

17. analysis_8 (3y OS)

18. analysis_8 (5y OS)

Wait, that's 18 entries. Wait in the user's input, the groundtruth results array has 18 elements? Let me check again:

Looking at the groundtruth's results array:

Counting:

1. analysis_1, metrics correlation coeff

2. analysis_1, p

3. analysis_2, AUC

4. analysis_2, 95% CI

15. analysis_7, AUC

16. analysis_8, 1y OS

17. analysis_8, 3y OS

18. analysis_8, 5y OS

19. analysis_10, features

Wait the last entry under groundtruth results is analysis_10, so total 19? Wait the user input shows the groundtruth results as:

After analysis_8's three entries (1y,3y,5y), then analysis_10 comes next. Let me recount:

Yes, the groundtruth results array has 19 entries. Let me confirm:

The groundtruth's results array ends with:

..., "analysis_10": { ... }, so the total is:

analysis_1:2, analysis_2:2, analysis_3:2, analysis_4:1, analysis_5:2, analysis_6:4 (wait original count might differ). Let me see the exact count:

Original groundtruth results:

Looking at the input, the groundtruth results array has:

1. analysis_1 (corr coeff)

2. analysis_1 (p)

3. analysis_2 (AUC)

4. analysis_2 (CI)

5. analysis_3 (AUC)

6. analysis_3 (CI)

7. analysis_4 (features)

8. analysis_5 (p)

9. analysis_5 (HR)

10. analysis_6 (K-M p)

11. analysis_6 (multivariate Cox HR)

12. analysis_6 (multivariate Cox p)

13. analysis_6 (univariate Cox HR)

14. analysis_6 (univariate Cox p)

15. analysis_7 (AUC)

16. analysis_8 (1y)

17. analysis_8 (3y)

18. analysis_8 (5y)

19. analysis_10 (features)

Total 19 entries.

The annotation's results array has:

Looking at the user-provided annotation results:

The results array has entries for:

analysis_1 (2 entries),

analysis_2 (2),

analysis_3 (2),

analysis_4 (1) – wait, in the annotation's results, analysis_4 is present? Let me check:

Wait in the annotation's results:

Looking at the input for the annotation's results:

The first entries are similar to groundtruth's analysis_1,2,3.

Then analysis_4 is present in the groundtruth's results but in the annotation's results, looking at the provided annotation's results array:

The annotation's results array has entries up to analysis_8 and analysis_10? Let me parse it step by step:

Annotation results array:

1. analysis_1 (corr coeff)

2. analysis_2 (AUC)

3. analysis_2 (CI)

4. analysis_3 (AUC)

5. analysis_3 (CI)

6. analysis_4 (features) – this is present? Wait in the user's annotation results, after analysis_3's two entries, the next is analysis_4's features? Wait the user's annotation results:

Looking at the user's provided annotation's results:

Yes, the sixth item is analysis_4's features entry.

Then:

7. analysis_5 (p)

8. analysis_5 (HR)

9. analysis_6 (K-M p)

10. analysis_6 (multivariate Cox HR)

11. analysis_6 (multivariate Cox p)

12. analysis_6 (univariate Cox HR value "<0.001")

Wait wait, in the groundtruth's analysis_6 has an extra entry for univariate Cox regression HR value "1.724...", but in the annotation's analysis_6 entries, there's an entry with "univariate Cox regression HR" having value "< 0.001", which might be conflicting. Let me check:

Groundtruth analysis_6 has two entries for univariate Cox regression HR and p? Let me see:

Groundtruth's analysis_6 has:

- "univariate Cox regression HR" with value "1.724 (95% CI: 1.294-2.298)",

- "univariate Cox regression p" with value <0.001,

And another entry with "metrics": "univariate Cox regression HR" with value "<0.001"? No, in groundtruth, looking back:

Wait in groundtruth's results for analysis_6:

There are four entries:

10. analysis_6: K-M p (value 4.208e-03)

11. multivariate Cox HR (value string)

12. multivariate Cox p (0.003)

13. univariate Cox HR: "1.724..." value

14. univariate Cox p: <0.001 (but the user's annotation has "univariate Cox regression HR" with value "<0.001", which is wrong because HR is a ratio, not a p-value. That's an error.)

Ah, here's a problem. In the annotation's analysis_6, there is an entry:

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "univariate Cox regression HR",
  "value": "< 0.001",
  ...
}

But in groundtruth, the univariate Cox regression HR has a numerical value (the HR itself), and the p-value is separate. So this is an error in the annotation. So the key-value pair here is incorrect.

Additionally, the annotation's analysis_6 has entries for:

- K-M p,

- multivariate Cox HR,

- multivariate Cox p,

- univariate Cox HR (wrong value),

- univariate Cox p (which might be missing? Wait in the groundtruth, analysis_6 has both univariate HR and p, but in the annotation's results, there's an extra entry for univariate Cox HR with the wrong value, and possibly missing the p?

Wait the groundtruth's analysis_6 has:

- analysis_6 has two univariate entries: HR and p. In the annotation, there's an entry with "univariate Cox regression HR" with value "<0.001" (which is actually the p-value), and another entry for "univariate Cox regression p" with value 0.003? Wait let me check the user's annotation's results:

Looking at the user's annotation results for analysis_6:

The entries are:

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "K-M p",
  "value": 0.004208,
  ...
},

{
  "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression HR",
  "value": "...",
},

{
  "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression p",
  "value": 0.003,
},

{
  "metrics": "univariate Cox regression HR",
  "value": "< 0.001",
},

Wait there's also another entry:

Wait in the user's annotation results, after the multivariate entries, there's another "univariate Cox regression HR" with value "<0.001". That's incorrect because the HR should be a numeric value, not a p-value. The p-value for univariate is supposed to be a separate entry. In the groundtruth, the univariate Cox regression p is listed as <0.001 (value "<0.001"), but the HR is "1.724...".

So in the annotation, the user incorrectly assigned the p-value to the HR metric. That's a content accuracy error. So that's a mistake in accuracy for that entry.

Additionally, does the annotation have all the necessary entries?

Let's count the annotation's results entries:

1. analysis_1 (2 entries)

2. analysis_2 (2)

3. analysis_3 (2)

4. analysis_4 (1)

5. analysis_5 (2)

6. analysis_6 (5 entries?)

Wait:

Looking at the user's annotation results array:

After analysis_5's two entries, the entries for analysis_6 are:

analysis_6 (K-M p),

multivariate Cox HR,

multivariate Cox p,

univariate Cox HR (incorrect value),

and possibly another entry for univariate Cox p? Wait in the user's annotation's results:

Looking at the JSON provided for the annotation's results:

The entries after analysis_5 are:

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "K-M p",
  "value": 0.004208,
  ...
},

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression HR",
  "value": "...",
},

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression p",
  "value": 0.003,
},

{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
  "metrics": "univariate Cox regression HR",
  "value": "< 0.001",
},

Wait, is there another entry for univariate Cox p in the annotation? In the groundtruth, analysis_6 has an entry with "univariate Cox regression p" with value <0.001. In the user's annotation, I don't see that. Looking at the provided JSON for the annotation's results:

The last entry under analysis_6 in the user's results is the "univariate Cox regression HR" with the wrong value. There's no entry for "univariate Cox regression p". So that's a missing entry in the results for analysis_6.

Therefore, the annotation's analysis_6 has fewer entries than groundtruth. The groundtruth has four entries for analysis_6, while the annotation has:

- K-M p,

- multivariate HR,

- multivariate p,

- univariate HR (wrong value),

so total 4 entries instead of 4? Wait groundtruth had four entries for analysis_6 (excluding the fifth?):

Wait the groundtruth's analysis_6 has:

- K-M p,

- multivariate HR,

- multivariate p,

- univariate HR,

- univariate p.

Wait actually in the groundtruth results for analysis_6:

Looking back, the groundtruth's analysis_6 has five entries? Let me check:

Original groundtruth results for analysis_6:

{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
    "metrics": "K-M p",
    "value": 4.208e-03,
    "features": ["NLRP1", "CHMP7", "CYCS"]
},
{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
    "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression HR",
    "value": "1.646 (95% CI: 1.189-2.278)",
    "features": [...]
},
{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
    "metrics": "multivariate Cox regression p",
    "value": 0.003,
    ...
},
{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
    "metrics": "univariate Cox regression HR",
    "value": "1.724 (95% CI: 1.294-2.298)",
    ...
},
{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_6",
    "metrics": "univariate Cox regression p",
    "value": "<0.001",
    ...
}

So five entries for analysis_6. In the annotation's results for analysis_6, there are four entries (missing the univariate Cox regression p). Also, the univariate HR's value is wrong.

So this is a problem.

Also, in the groundtruth results, analysis_4 (features list) is present, which the annotation includes. Similarly, analysis_8 has three entries (1y, 3y, 5y OS AUC), which the annotation has those.

The groundtruth also has analysis_10's features entry, which the annotation includes as well.

Now, let's count the total results entries in the annotation:

analysis_1: 2,

analysis_2:2,

analysis_3:2,

analysis_4:1,

analysis_5:2,

analysis_6:4 (missing the univariate p entry),

analysis_7:1,

analysis_8:3,

analysis_10:1.

Total: 2+2+2+1+2+4+1+3+1= 18 entries. But groundtruth has 19. So one missing entry: analysis_6's univariate Cox regression p.

Additionally, the analysis_6's univariate HR entry has incorrect value.

Other discrepancies?

Looking at analysis_8's entries in the groundtruth and annotation:

The groundtruth's analysis_8 has three entries (1y, 3y, 5y OS AUC) which are present in the annotation correctly.

The analysis_10's features in the groundtruth lists pathways, and the annotation has the same.

Now, calculating completeness:

Groundtruth has 19 results entries. The annotation has 18 (missing one: analysis_6's univariate Cox p). So missing 1. Thus, completeness deduction is (1/19)*40 ≈2.1 points. So completeness score is 40 -2.1≈37.9 (~38).

Structure: Check each result entry's keys. All entries have analysis_id, metrics, value, features. The structure looks correct. So 10 points.

Content accuracy:

Now, for accuracy, existing entries must be checked for correctness. The main issues are:

1. In analysis_6's univariate Cox regression HR entry, the value is incorrectly "<0.001" instead of the HR value. This is a significant error, so that entry's accuracy is wrong. The metrics is "univariate Cox regression HR" but the value is a p-value. That's a critical mistake. So this entry's key-value pair is wrong.

Additionally, the missing univariate Cox p entry is a completeness issue, not accuracy. But the existing entries must be accurate. So for the analysis_6's entries:

- K-M p: correct.

- multivariate HR and p: correct.

- univariate HR (wrong value): this entry is incorrect, so it deducts points.

- The missing univariate p is a completeness deduction.

Other entries:

Analysis_4's features list: same as groundtruth.

Analysis_5's entries: correct.

Analysis_7's AUC: correct.

Analysis_8's entries: correct.

Analysis_10: correct.

So the only major accuracy issue is the analysis_6's univariate HR entry. How much does this deduct?

Each result entry is a sub-object. The total accuracy is 50 points. The number of entries in groundtruth is 19, so each entry is worth about 50/19≈2.63 points. The incorrect entry (analysis_6's univariate HR) would deduct that. So 2.63 points lost. Also, the missing entry (univariate p) is a completeness issue, not accuracy. So total accuracy is 50 -2.63≈47.37 (~47).

But perhaps the scoring is more holistic. Since only one key-value pair is wrong (the HR value), but the rest are correct. The HR entry is incorrect, so that's a deduction. Maybe deduct 5 points for that error. Or maybe per entry: if that entry is counted as incorrect, then (number correct / total present) ?

Alternatively, the content accuracy is for the matched sub-objects (those present in both groundtruth and annotation). For the existing entries in the annotation, except the erroneous one, are they correct?

Except for the analysis_6's univariate HR entry, all others match. So out of 18 entries (annotation's entries), 17 are correct. So accuracy score is (17/18)*50 ≈46.67 (~47). 

So total results score would be:

Structure:10,

Completeness: ~38,

Accuracy: ~47,

Total 10+38+47=95?

Wait but let me recalculate precisely:

Completeness deduction: 1 missing entry (out of 19) → 40*(18/19)= ~37.89.

Accuracy: one incorrect entry (out of 18) → (17/18)*50≈46.67.

So total:10 +37.89 +46.67≈94.56 → ~95.

But need to consider other possible errors. Are there any others?

Looking at analysis_4's features list in the groundtruth and annotation: the features lists are identical? Let me compare.

Groundtruth analysis_4's features include "positive regulation of cytokine production", etc., and the annotation's analysis_4 has the same list. So that's correct.

Analysis_10's features: groundtruth lists pathways like "pyrimidine metabolism", and the annotation includes the same entries. So that's okay.

Another possible issue: In the annotation's analysis_6's multivariate Cox regression HR's value is written as "1.646 (95% CI: 1.189-2.278)" which matches groundtruth. The univariate Cox regression HR in groundtruth has "1.724 (95% CI: 1.294-2.298)", but in the annotation's incorrect entry, it's written as "<0.001" which is wrong.

Therefore, only that one entry is incorrect. Hence accuracy loss is minimal (maybe 5 points off from 50 →45?), but precise calculation as above gives ~47.

So rounding, maybe:

Data: 10 (structure) +20 (completeness) +50 =80.

Analyses:10+ (13/17)*40≈30.57 → ~30.57 +50 → total 90.57≈91.

Results:10+38+47≈95.

Final scores:

Data: 80,

Analyses: 91,

Results: 95.

But I need to verify again.

Wait for Data:

Groundtruth has 6 data entries, annotation has 3 (missing data_2,4,6). So 3 missing. Each missing is (40/6)=6.666 per missing. So 3×6.666=20 deduction. Completeness is 40-20=20. So Data:10+20+50=80. Correct.

Analyses:

17 groundtruth analyses, 13 present. 4 missing. Each missing costs 40/17≈2.35 per missing. 4×2.35≈9.4 deduction → 40-9.4=30.6. So 30.6 completeness. So total 10+30.6+50≈90.6→91.

Results:

19 groundtruth results entries. Annotation has 18 (missing one). So 1 missing → 40*(18/19)= ~37.89. Accuracy: one incorrect entry out of 18 → (17/18)*50≈46.67. So total 10+37.89+46.67≈94.56→~95.

Thus Final Scores:

Data:80,

Analyses:91,

Results:95.

But maybe the user made another mistake in Results. Let me double-check.

In the analysis_6 of the annotation's results, the univariate Cox regression HR entry has the wrong value. Is that the only error? Yes. So that's one incorrect entry. So the accuracy loss is (1/18)*50 ≈2.78, so 50-2.78=47.22.

Thus, rounding to integers:

Data:80,

Analyses:91,

Results:95.

Alternatively, the results accuracy could be lower. Suppose each key-value pair error is penalized more. For instance, the HR value being completely wrong (p instead of HR) might lose more points. If that single entry is considered a major error, maybe deduct 10 points from accuracy (50-10=40). Then total results would be 10+38+40=88. But that depends on severity.

Alternatively, the key-value pair for that entry is entirely incorrect, so that sub-object is incorrect. Since the question says "for sub-objects deemed semantically matched in 'Content Completeness', evaluate their key-value pairs". If the sub-object is considered matched (same analysis_id and metrics), but the value is wrong, then it's an accuracy deduction.

Assuming that the sub-object (analysis_6's univariate Cox HR entry) is present but has wrong value, so it's considered a semantic discrepancy. So for that one entry, the accuracy is wrong. Assuming each such error deducts (50/total_entries). With 19 entries in groundtruth, but in the annotation's existing 18, one is incorrect. So per entry: 50/19≈2.63 per entry. So losing 2.63 for that one entry. Thus accuracy is 50 -2.63 ≈47.37. So rounding to 47. Total results: 10+38+47=95.

I think that's fair. So the final scores would be:

Data:80,

Analyses:91,

Results:95.

But I should also check if there are other errors.

Wait, in the annotation's analyses section, analysis_13 uses "data" instead of "analysis_data"? Looking back:

In the groundtruth's analysis_13, it's written as:

{"id": "analysis_13", "analysis_name": "TME", "data": ["data_5"]}

The annotation's analysis_13 is the same, so correct.

Another possible issue: In the analysis_9 of the groundtruth, the label key has an empty string key ("") with values ["Tumor", "Normal"]. In the annotation's analysis_9, it's the same. Though the empty string key might be an error, but since it's present in both, it's considered correct.

Therefore, my final conclusion is the scores as above.

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 80,
    "Analyses": 91,
    "Results": 95
