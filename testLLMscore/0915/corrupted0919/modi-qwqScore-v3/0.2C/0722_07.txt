Okay, I need to score the annotation result against the groundtruth provided. Let me start by understanding the task details again.

First, the user wants scores for three objects: data, analyses, and results. Each has a max of 100 points, split into structure (10), content completeness (40), and content accuracy (50). 

Starting with the "data" object. Both groundtruth and annotation have four entries. Let me check structure first. Each sub-object should have all keys, even if optional ones are empty. The keys required for data are omics, link, source, data_format, public_id, and id. Looking at the groundtruth and the annotation, they both include all these keys except maybe data_format? Wait, in the groundtruth's data, the data_format field isn't present, but looking back, the user said that for data, link, source, data_format, and public_id are optional. So even if some are empty, as long as the keys exist, it's okay. 

Looking at the data entries:

Groundtruth Data:
- Each entry has id, omics, link (empty), source (some filled), public_id (filled or empty). The structure seems correct. Same for the annotation's data. The structure looks good, so structure score is 10 for both data sections.

Next, content completeness for data: Each sub-object must be present. Groundtruth has four data entries. The annotation also has four. Check if all are there. The ids are different in numbering? Wait no, the ids like data_1 to data_4 are the same in both. The order might differ, but since the instruction says to ignore order and focus on content. So the sub-objects are all present. No missing ones, so full 40 points here? Unless something's missing. Let me check each:

Data_1: single-cell RNA-seq data, source NODE, public_id OEP003254 – both match.
Data_2: bulk RNA-seq data, same source and public_id – matches.
Data_3: proteomics, source and public_id empty – matches.
Data_4: metabolomics, same as above. 

So all four are present, no extra or missing. So content completeness is 40. 

Now content accuracy: check each key's values. Since omics terms are exact? Let's see:

For data_1 and 2: omics terms match exactly. Data_3 and 4 also match. The optional fields like link and format are empty in both, so no issues. Source and public_id for data_3 and 4 are empty in both, so that's okay. Since the instructions say to consider semantic equivalence, even if wording differs, but here they are same. So content accuracy is 50. So data total is 10 +40 +50 = 100. 

Wait, but wait: the groundtruth's data_3 and data_4 have source and public_id empty, which is reflected in the annotation. So nothing wrong here. So yes, data gets 100.

Moving to analyses. Groundtruth has six analyses, the annotation has six as well. Let's check structure first. Each analysis should have id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The optional fields are analysis_data, training_set, test_set, label, label_file. But analysis_data is present here. So checking structure:

Each sub-object in analyses has id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The structure is correct, so structure is 10.

Content completeness: check if all sub-objects are present. Groundtruth analyses have:

analysis_1 to analysis_6. The annotation has analysis_1 through analysis_6 as well. But let's look at the analysis names and data links to see if they correspond semantically.

Groundtruth analysis_2 is called "Bulk Transcriptomics", pointing to data_2. In the annotation, analysis_2 is "Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA)", linked to data_1. Wait, that's a difference. Hmm. 

Wait, the analysis names don't match here. So the sub-object for analysis_2 in groundtruth vs. the annotation: the names are different. So does this count as missing?

The user says that when evaluating content completeness, if a sub-object is semantically different, then it doesn't count as a match. So analysis_2 in groundtruth is "Bulk Transcriptomics" linked to data_2, but the annotation's analysis_2 is a different name and different data. That would mean the groundtruth's analysis_2 is missing in the annotation, but the annotation added an extra one (MSEA). So that's a problem.

Wait, how many sub-objects does each have? Groundtruth has 6: analysis_1 to 6. The annotation also has 6. But the second entry differs. Let me list them:

Groundtruth analyses:
1. Single-cell analysis (data_1)
2. Bulk Transcriptomics (data_2)
3. Proteomics (data_3)
4. Metabolomics (data_4)
5. Differentially expressed analysis (links to analyses 2,3,4)
6. survival analysis (no data)

Annotation analyses:
1. Single-cell analysis (data_1)
2. Marker set enrichment analysis (data_1)
3. Proteomics (data_3)
4. Metabolomics (data_4)
5. Differentially expressed analysis (links to analyses 2,3,4)
6. survival analysis (no data)

So the groundtruth's analysis_2 ("Bulk Transcriptomics") is missing in the annotation. Instead, the annotation has analysis_2 as MSEA, which wasn't in the groundtruth. So the annotation is missing the "Bulk Transcriptomics" analysis (analysis_2 from groundtruth), but has an extra MSEA (analysis_2 in their own). 

Therefore, in content completeness, since the groundtruth requires analysis_2 (Bulk...) but the annotation has a different analysis in its place, that counts as missing. So the annotation is missing one sub-object (Bulk Transcriptomics), but has an extra one. However, the instructions mention that extra sub-objects may incur penalties depending on relevance. 

But the content completeness is based on the groundtruth's required sub-objects. Since one is missing (the Bulk Transcriptomics), and one extra is present (MSEA), then the annotation has 5 correct sub-objects (excluding the incorrect one) plus an extra? Or does the presence of the extra penalize? 

Wait, the instructions for content completeness say: "deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches. Thoroughly analyze each groundtruth sub-object's semantic correspondence before determining equivalency. Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

So first, for each missing groundtruth sub-object, we deduct. Here, the groundtruth's analysis_2 (Bulk Transcriptomics) is missing because the annotation's analysis_2 is a different thing. So that's a missing sub-object. So content completeness starts at 40, minus (number of missing * (40/total groundtruth sub-objects))? Wait, how to calculate deduction?

The content completeness is out of 40. There are 6 sub-objects in groundtruth. Each missing one would be 40*(1/6) per missing. Since one is missing (Bulk Transcriptomics), that's a 40*(1/6) ≈6.66 penalty. But maybe the deduction is 40 divided by number of sub-objects. Alternatively, perhaps each missing sub-object deducts 40 / number of required sub-objects. 

Alternatively, since the total is 40 for completeness, each missing sub-object is worth (40/6) ~6.66 points. So missing one would deduct ~6.66, bringing it down to 33.33. Also, the presence of an extra sub-object (MSEA) may add another penalty? The instruction says "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." 

Is the MSEA relevant? It's part of the analyses, but not present in groundtruth. Since the groundtruth didn't have it, adding an extra might be penalized. How much? Maybe another 6.66? Because adding an extra when not needed. 

Alternatively, maybe the total possible is 40, and each missing is a deduction, but extras are also deductions. Let me think again. The user says "deduct points for missing any sub-object" and "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties".

So first, for missing one sub-object (Bulk Transcriptomics), deduct (40/6)*1 ≈6.66. Then, for the extra sub-object (MSEA), which is not present in groundtruth, deduct another (40/6)*1? Because it's an extra. So total deduction is 13.33, leading to 40 -13.33=26.66. But rounding might be involved. Alternatively, maybe each missing and extra counts as half a point or something? Not sure. Need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the total completeness is calculated as follows: 

Each sub-object in groundtruth must be present in the annotation, either exactly or semantically equivalent. For each missing, subtract (40 / N), where N is the number of groundtruth sub-objects. For each extra non-equivalent sub-object, subtract the same amount. 

In this case, the groundtruth has 6 sub-objects. The annotation has 6. One is missing (Bulk Transcriptomics), one is extra (MSEA). So total missing:1, extra:1. Total deductions: 2*(40/6)= 13.33. Thus, 40 -13.33≈26.66. But maybe the exact calculation is needed. Alternatively, since the user says "extra may incur penalties depending on context". Since MSEA is an analysis, perhaps it's somewhat related but not required, so maybe only penalize the missing one. Maybe the extra isn't penalized because it's an additional analysis that could be valid but not in the groundtruth. However, the instructions say to deduct for missing and for extra. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me proceed step by step:

Groundtruth analyses has 6 sub-objects. The annotation has 6, but one is missing (Bulk Transcriptomics) and one is added (MSEA). So the number of correctly matched sub-objects is 5 (since analysis_2 is not matching). So correct matches are 5. The content completeness score would be (5/6)*40 ≈ 33.33. Because you're getting partial credit for having most but missing one. Alternatively, if it's strictly that each missing one reduces the score by (40/6). So 6 missing causes full deduction. Here, missing 1: 40 - (40/6)*1 ≈ 33.33. The extra doesn't affect unless the instruction says to penalize for extra. The instruction says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties". Depending on context. Since MSEA is an analysis that's part of the data, perhaps it's acceptable but since it's not in groundtruth, the presence is considered an extra, hence penalty. 

If we consider both missing and extra as penalties, each subtracts (40/6), so total deduction is 2*(40/6)=13.33, resulting in 26.66. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. The user might expect that the number of correct matches determines it. Since there are 5 correct (excluding the missing and the extra?), but actually, the extra is not a correct match. So the correct matches are 5 (since analysis_2 in GT is missing, analysis_2 in AN is new; other analyses from 1,3,4,5,6 match? Wait analysis_5 in groundtruth refers to analysis_2,3,4. In the annotation's analysis_5, analysis_data is [analysis_2 (which is MSEA), analysis_3, analysis_4]. The analysis_data for analysis_5 in groundtruth is analysis_2 (Bulk Transcriptomics), analysis_3, analysis_4. So the data links are different because analysis_2 in the annotation is MSEA instead of Bulk. So analysis_5's data in the annotation is pointing to a different analysis_2, which might affect whether analysis_5 is considered a match. 

This complicates things. Let's re-examine each analysis:

Analysis_1: same in both. So that's a match.

Analysis_2: GT has "Bulk Transcriptomics" linked to data_2. Annotation has "Marker..." linked to data_1. So not a match. So this is a missing and an extra.

Analysis_3: both are "Proteomics" linked to data_3 – matches.

Analysis_4: both "Metabolomics" linked to data4 – matches.

Analysis_5: in GT, it uses analysis_2 (Bulk), 3,4. In AN, it uses analysis_2 (MSEA),3,4. So the analysis_data references are different. Does that make analysis_5 a mismatch? Because the analysis_data is different. Wait, analysis_5's analysis_data is supposed to link to the analyses that provided data. In GT, it's analysis_2 (Bulk Transcriptomics), analysis_3,4. In AN, analysis_2 is now MSEA (different analysis). So the analysis_5 in AN is referencing a different analysis_2. So does that make analysis_5 not semantically equivalent? The analysis_5's purpose is "Differentially expressed analysis", which in GT uses the bulk transcriptomics data (from analysis_2), whereas in AN it uses the MSEA. 

Depending on whether the differential analysis in AN is using different inputs, it might not be the same as GT's analysis_5. Hence, analysis_5 in AN might not match GT's analysis_5 because the inputs are different. Thus, analysis_5 in AN would not be equivalent. So then analysis_5 is also missing?

Wait, the analysis_5 in AN still has the name "Differentially expressed analysis", but with different analysis_data. The name is the same but the data it's analyzing is different. Is that considered a match? The user says to prioritize semantic equivalence over literal. The name is the same, but the input data is different (using MSEA instead of Bulk Transcriptomics). That might mean it's a different analysis, so analysis_5 in AN isn't equivalent to GT's analysis_5. Thus, analysis_5 is also missing in AN compared to GT. 

Then analysis_5 would be a missing sub-object. Similarly, the AN's analysis_5 is a different analysis, so that's an extra? Or not. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to tabulate each:

GT Analyses:

1. Analysis_1 (Single-cell analysis, data_1) → Matched in AN's analysis_1.

2. Analysis_2 (Bulk Transcriptomics, data_2) → Not present in AN (AN's analysis_2 is MSEA).

3. Analysis_3 (Proteomics, data_3) → Matches.

4. Analysis_4 (Metabolomics, data_4) → Matches.

5. Analysis_5 (Diff Exp, data [analysis_2,3,4]) → In AN's analysis_5, the data links to analysis_2 (MSEA),3,4. Since analysis_2 is different, this is a different analysis. So not a match. So GT's analysis_5 is missing.

6. Analysis_6 (Survival analysis) → Matches.

Thus, in the AN, the analyses present are:

AN analyses:

1. analysis_1 (matches GT1)

2. analysis_2 (new, not matching GT2)

3. analysis_3 (matches GT3)

4. analysis_4 (matches GT4)

5. analysis_5 (name same as GT5 but data different → not a match)

6. analysis_6 (matches GT6)

So the matches are analyses 1,3,4,6 → 4 matches. The GT has analyses 1,2,3,4,5,6 → 6 total. So missing are GT2 and GT5 (both are not matched). Plus, AN has analysis_2 (extra) and analysis_5 (which is named similarly but not semantically same). 

Wait, analysis_5 in AN has the same name as GT5 but different data. The name is the same but the content (data sources) differ, so they aren't semantically equivalent. Thus, GT5 is missing, and AN's analysis_5 is an extra. 

Therefore, total missing sub-objects in AN compared to GT are 2 (analysis_2 and analysis_5). The extras are analysis_2 (MSEA) and analysis_5 (diff exp with different data). 

Thus, for content completeness: 

Number of missing: 2 → deduction is (2)*(40/6) ≈ 13.33. 

Number of extra sub-objects: 2 → but the instructions say "extra may incur penalties depending on context". Whether to deduct for extras? The user says "may also incur penalties". Since the MSEA is an analysis that's not in GT, adding it is an extra. The analysis_5 in AN is an attempt to replicate GT's analysis_5 but with wrong dependencies, so it's not a correct match but an incorrect one, so maybe it's considered an extra? 

Assuming that each missing deducts (40/6) and each extra also deducts (40/6), then total deductions would be (2+2)*(40/6) → but that might be overcounting. Alternatively, the extras are only penalized if they are not semantically matching anything. Since the MSEA isn't present in GT, it's an extra. The analysis_5 in AN is an attempt but not matching GT's analysis_5, so it's an extra. So two extras. 

Total deductions: missing (2) + extras (2) → 4*(40/6) ≈ 26.66. 

Thus, content completeness score would be 40 - 26.66 ≈ 13.33. But that seems low. Alternatively, maybe the extras are only penalized if they are not part of the groundtruth. 

Alternatively, the content completeness is calculated as:

Correct matches: 4 (analysis1,3,4,6). 

Total groundtruth sub-objects:6. 

So completeness score is (correct / total)*40 → (4/6)*40 ≈ 26.66. 

That's probably better. Since the correct matches are 4 out of 6, so 26.66. 

Then content accuracy: for the matched sub-objects (analysis1,3,4,6), check their key-value pairs. 

Analysis1: 

GT: analysis_name "Single-cell analysis", analysis_data "data_1"

AN: same. So accurate. 

Analysis3: same name and data. Accurate. 

Analysis4: same. Accurate. 

Analysis6: name "survival analysis", analysis_data is empty array in both. So accurate. 

So these four have perfect accuracy. 

Now, what about analysis5 in GT (missing in AN), but AN has analysis5 with different data. Since analysis5 in GT is not matched in AN, so it's not counted in the accuracy part. Accuracy is only for matched sub-objects. 

Thus, for the four matched analyses, all their key-value pairs are correct. So content accuracy is 50. 

But wait, the analysis_data for analysis_5 in AN is different, but since that analysis isn't considered a match, it's excluded from accuracy. 

Thus, content accuracy is 50. 

So total analyses score would be structure (10) + completeness (~26.66) + accuracy (50) → total ≈ 86.66. Rounded to 87? Or maybe keep decimals as per instructions. 

Wait, but let's recalculate precisely:

Completeness: (4/6)*40 = (2/3)*40 = 26.666...

Accuracy: 50 (since the four matched are perfect)

So total is 10+26.666+50 = 86.666..., so 86.67. 

But maybe the user expects integer values, so maybe 87. 

Alternatively, perhaps the content completeness was miscalculated. Let's double-check.

Alternative approach for content completeness: 

Each missing sub-object (GT2 and GT5) deducts 40/6 each. So 2*(40/6)=13.33. 

Extras: Adding analysis2 (MSEA) and analysis5 (non-matching) are two extras, but do they count towards deduction? The user says "may also incur penalties". If we deduct for each extra, another 2*(40/6)=13.33. Total deduction 26.66. So starting at 40, minus 26.66 gives 13.33. But that would lead to lower score. But that seems harsh. 

Alternatively, the instruction says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance". Since MSEA is an analysis, but not part of the groundtruth, adding it is unnecessary. So penalizing for that. But analysis5 is an attempt but incorrect, so it's an error rather than an extra. 

This is getting too ambiguous. To simplify, let's assume that content completeness is based on the number of correctly matched sub-objects out of groundtruth's. So correct matches are 4 (out of 6), so 4/6 of 40 is ~26.67. 

Thus, analyses score is 10 +26.67 +50=86.67 → 87. 

Now moving to results section.

Groundtruth results has one entry:

{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_5",
    "metrics": "Differentially expressed genes between PMN and TANs",
    "value": "",
    "features": ["BHLHE40", "LDHA", etc]
}

Annotation's result has:

{
    "analysis_id": "analysis_3",
    "metrics": "precision",
    "value":4279,
    "features": [some codes]
}

First, structure: results entries must have analysis_id, metrics, value, features. The optional fields are metric and value (wait, the user says for results: metric and value are optional. Wait, in the instructions under results, the optional fields are "metric and value is optional". Wait, looking back:

"For Part of Results, metric and value is optional"

So in the results' sub-objects, metrics and value are optional. But features is required? The structure requires that the keys exist even if empty? Or the keys must be present regardless of optionality?

The structure score is about correct JSON structure, not content. So even if a key is optional, if it's missing entirely, that's a structure issue. 

In groundtruth's result, all keys (analysis_id, metrics, value, features) are present (even though value is empty). In the annotation's result, all keys are present (analysis_id, metrics, value, features). So structure is okay. So structure score is 10. 

Content completeness: Groundtruth has one sub-object. The annotation has one as well. Are they semantically equivalent?

The groundtruth's result is tied to analysis_5 (differential expr analysis), metrics about DE genes between cell types, features are specific gene names. 

The annotation's result is tied to analysis_3 (proteomics analysis), metrics "precision" with value 4279, features are codes like "chABSVn3B". 

These are clearly different results. The analysis_id is different, the metrics and features don't align. So the groundtruth's result sub-object is missing in the annotation. The annotation has an extra result that's not in the groundtruth. 

Thus, content completeness: the groundtruth requires one sub-object, which is missing in the annotation. The annotation has an extra one. 

So for content completeness (out of 40):

Missing one sub-object: deduct (1/1)*40 → 40 points. But since there's one groundtruth sub-object, missing it is 40 deduction. However, since the annotation has an extra, which may also penalize. 

Wait, content completeness: 

Number of groundtruth sub-objects is 1. 

The annotation has 1, but it's not matching. So correct matches: 0. 

Thus, completeness score is (0/1)*40 = 0. 

Additionally, the extra sub-object may incur a penalty. Since the user says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties". So if the groundtruth has 1, and the annotation has 1 extra (since their one doesn't match), then total deduction is 40 (for missing) plus 40 (for extra?), but that can't exceed the total. 

Wait, the formula would be:

content completeness starts at 40, minus (number of missing * (40/groundtruth_count)). Since groundtruth_count is 1:

missing 1 → deduct 40*(1/1)=40 → 0. 

Extras are additional deductions? Or is it just the missing? The instruction says "deduct points for missing any sub-object. Extra may also incur penalties...". So possibly, the extra doesn't add to the deduction beyond the missing. Since the maximum deduction is 40 (the total possible), so content completeness score is 0. 

Then content accuracy: since there are no correctly matched sub-objects (the annotation's result doesn't match the groundtruth's), so accuracy score is 0. 

Thus, results total is structure 10 + completeness 0 + accuracy 0 = 10. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Since the annotation's result is not semantically equivalent to the groundtruth's, so no match. Thus, the content accuracy (50 points) applies only to matched sub-objects. Since none are matched, 0. 

Yes. So results get 10 (structure) +0+0=10. 

Putting it all together:

Data: 100

Analyses: ~86.67 → 87 (rounded)

Results: 10 

But let me verify again:

For analyses:

Structure:10

Completeness: 26.666...

Accuracy:50

Total: 86.666… which can be written as 86.67, but since the user might want integers, maybe 87. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analysis completeness. Let's see:

If the groundtruth had 6 analyses, and the annotation has 6, but two are missing (GT2 and GT5), and two are extra (AN2 and AN5), then the correct matches are 4 (analysis1,3,4,6). 

So (4/6)*40 = 26.666…

Accuracy is 50. So total 86.666… 

Alternatively, if the analysis_5 in AN is considered an error in linking but still part of the analysis, maybe it's a partial match. But since the name is the same but inputs are different, it's not a semantic match. 

Alternatively, maybe the analysis_5 in AN is trying to match GT's analysis_5 but has wrong data links. Would that affect the completeness? 

No, because for completeness, it's about existence of sub-objects. Since analysis_5 in AN doesn't match GT's analysis_5 (because the analysis_data is different), it's not counted as a match. 

Thus, the calculations seem correct. 

Final scores:

Data:100

Analyses:87 (or 86.67)

Results:10

But according to the instructions, we must present the final scores with numbers, possibly rounded. The user might accept decimal points. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "total score out of 100 points" but doesn't specify rounding. Probably round to whole numbers.

Thus, analyses:87, results:10.

Wait, but results' structure is 10, and the rest 0. So total 10. 

Final Scores:

"Final Scores": {

    "Data": 100,

    "Analyses": 87,

    "Results": 10

}

But let me check the results again. The structure of the results is correct (all keys present), so structure score is 10. Even though the content is wrong, structure is okay. 

Yes. So that's correct. 

Another point: in the results' value field, the groundtruth has an empty string, and the annotation has a numerical value. Since value is optional, maybe that's okay? Wait, value is optional, so even if it's missing, it's allowed. The groundtruth has "", which is present, so the annotation's having a value is okay. But since the metrics and features are different, the semantic match is missing. 

Yes, so the previous calculations hold. 

I think that's it.

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 100,
    "Analyses": 87,
    "Results": 10
}

### Scoring Process Explanation

#### **Data**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  All sub-objects have the correct keys (`id`, `omics`, `link`, `source`, `data_format`, `public_id`). Optional fields like `link` and `source` are allowed to be empty, so no deductions.

- **Content Completeness (40/40)**  
  All four sub-objects in the groundtruth are present in the annotation with the same content (e.g., `omics` terms, `public_id`). No missing or extra sub-objects.

- **Content Accuracy (50/50)**  
  All key-value pairs match semantically (e.g., `omics` terms like "single-cell RNA-seq data" are identical). Optional fields like `public_id` are correctly omitted where applicable.

---

#### **Analyses**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  All sub-objects have the required keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`). Optional fields like `training_set` are absent but allowed.

- **Content Completeness (26.67/40)**  
  Groundtruth has **6** analyses. The annotation has **6**, but two critical mismatches:  
  - **Missing**:  
    - `analysis_2`: "Bulk Transcriptomics" (linked to `data_2`) is absent. The annotation replaces it with "Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA)".  
    - `analysis_5`: The differential expression analysis in the annotation references `analysis_2` (now MSEA instead of the original "Bulk Transcriptomics"), breaking semantic equivalence.  
  - **Extra**:  
    - "Marker set enrichment analysis" adds an irrelevant sub-object.  
    - The modified `analysis_5` is not semantically equivalent.  
  **Calculation**:  
  `(Correct Matches: 4/6) × 40 = 26.67`.

- **Content Accuracy (50/50)**  
  The **four matched sub-objects** (`analysis_1`, `analysis_3`, `analysis_4`, `analysis_6`) have accurate key-value pairs. The mismatched sub-objects (GT `analysis_2` and `analysis_5`) are excluded from this evaluation.

---

#### **Results**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  The sub-object includes all required keys (`analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`). Empty values (e.g., `value` in groundtruth) are allowed.

- **Content Completeness (0/40)**  
  The groundtruth result (`analysis_5`, "Differentially expressed genes") is **completely absent** in the annotation. The annotation’s result ties to `analysis_3` ("precision") with unrelated `features`, making it non-equivalent.  

- **Content Accuracy (0/50)**  
  No semantically equivalent sub-object exists to evaluate accuracy.

---

### Final Adjustments
Scores are rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity. The **Results** score remains at **10** due to structural correctness despite content failures.
