Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component:**

First, check Structure. The predicted data has six entries, same as ground truth. Each entry should have id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. 

Looking at data_5 in predicted: omics is empty, link is empty, format is "txt", source is empty, public_id empty. In ground truth, data_5 has omics as "RNA-seq", link to LinkedOmics, source as LinkedOmics, public_id TCGA-HNSCC. So the predicted data_5 is incomplete here. Also, data_6 in predicted matches except maybe public_id (both HNSCC). 

Wait, data_5 in ground truth has public_id "TCGA-HNSCC", but predicted's data_5 has public_id empty. So the structure seems okay because all keys exist, but the values are missing or wrong. For structure, since all keys are there, maybe structure is okay. But maybe some fields like "data" vs "analysis_data"? Wait no, structure is about being valid JSON and key-value pairs. 

Structure: All entries have the required keys, so structure is good. Deduct zero?

Accuracy: The predicted data_5 is mostly incorrect. It misses omics type, source, public ID. So this is a major inaccuracy. Data_6 is okay except format is empty, which matches ground truth (since ground truth also has empty format). 

Completeness: Ground truth has 6 entries, predicted has 6. But data_5 is incorrect. However, the other entries (1-4 and 6) are accurate except data_5. So missing data? No, it's present but wrong. So completeness is almost there except data_5 is wrong. 

So Accuracy deduction: Maybe 30% loss? Because one out of six entries is completely off. Completeness might be similar. So overall Data score: Maybe 70? Or lower?

Wait, let me think again. Data_5 in ground truth is RNA-seq from LinkedOmics, public_id TCGA-HNSCC. Predicted has omics empty, link empty, etc. That's a big miss. So accuracy would lose significant points here. Since one of six data entries is entirely wrong, that's ~16% loss. Plus others are correct except maybe data_5. So accuracy could be 80% (if one out of six is wrong), but since the wrong one is a major part, maybe more like 60%. Structure is perfect. Completeness: since they included all entries but one is wrong, so completeness is 83%, so maybe 83. Hmm, but the problem says to penalize for missing or extra. Since they didn't miss any entries, but had an extra wrong one, but the count is right. 

Overall, perhaps Data gets 70-75. Let me note deductions:

Structure: 100 (all keys present)

Accuracy: data_5 is completely wrong, so 1/6 = 16% penalty. Also, data_5's format in ground truth is empty but predicted has "txt"—maybe another minor issue. So total accuracy: 100 - (16 + maybe 5?) → 79? 

Completeness: Since all entries are there but one is incorrect, maybe 83% (since 5 correct out of 6). But since they are present but wrong, does that count as missing? The instructions say to count semantically equivalent as valid, but if not, then they're missing. Since data_5's content is wrong, it's considered incomplete. So maybe 5/6 → ~83% → 83. 

Total Data score: maybe average or combined. Since Accuracy and Completeness are both around 80, and Structure is full. Maybe (100 + 80 + 80)/3 ≈ 87? Wait, but the scoring criteria says each component has its own score. Wait, the user wants separate scores for each component, each scored 0-100 based on their own structure, accuracy, completeness. So for Data component:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, all keys present)

Accuracy: Let's see. Data_1 to Data_4 and Data_6 are correct. Data_5 is entirely wrong. So 5/6 accurate, so 83.3%. So 83.3% accuracy. But maybe the format for Data_5 in ground truth is empty, but predicted has "txt"—so that's an error. So accuracy would be (5 entries fully correct except Data_5's format is wrong, but the main info is omics type, source, public_id which are wrong in Data_5). So Data_5 contributes 0 towards accuracy. Hence 5/6=83.3 accuracy.

Completeness: Need to cover all relevant objects. Since all are present but one is incorrect, but presence counts? Wait, the instruction says to penalize for missing or extra. Since they have all entries (no missing or extra), completeness is 100, but the content of Data_5 is wrong. Wait, maybe completeness is about coverage of ground truth's items. If you have an item that's not in the ground truth, that's bad, but here all are present. So maybe completeness is 100, but accuracy is penalized. Alternatively, maybe completeness considers that incorrect entries don't count. Hmm, this is confusing. 

The notes say: "Count semantically equivalent objects as valid, even if the wording differs. Penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects."

So for completeness, if the predicted has an object that's not in the ground truth, that's a penalty. Here, all data entries are present (same count), but Data_5 is not semantically equivalent. Therefore, completeness would be (5/6)*100 ~83.3.

Thus, for Data component:

Structure: 100

Accuracy: 83.3 (5 correct entries out of 6)

Completeness: 83.3 (same as accuracy here)

Total Data score: Maybe average of the three? Or each aspect contributes equally? The user didn't specify, but instructions say to score each component based on three aspects. Probably each aspect is weighted equally. So:

(100 + 83.3 + 83.3)/3 ≈ 89. But maybe the user expects to combine them differently. Alternatively, maybe the overall score is computed by considering the three aspects multiplicatively or additively. Since the instructions aren't clear, but in typical grading, each aspect contributes to the score. Assuming equal weight:

Total Data score: (100 + 83.3 + 83.3)/3 = ~89. But perhaps the user wants each aspect's contribution to be considered. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a pass/fail, and the rest are graded. Since structure is 100, maybe focus on the other two aspects. 

Alternatively, maybe the maximum possible is 100, and each aspect's score is averaged. Let's proceed with 89 for Data.

Moving on to Analyses.

**Analyses Component:**

First, Structure: Check if each analysis object has valid JSON and proper key-value. 

Looking at the analyses in predicted:

Analysis_3 has analysis_name empty, training_set and label as empty strings. That's invalid structure because those fields should probably be either omitted or properly formatted. Wait, in ground truth, analysis_3 has analysis_name "MLGenie", training_set array, label with NPC. In predicted analysis_3, the keys exist but have empty values. That's invalid structure because they should be arrays or objects. For example, training_set is a string "" instead of an array. Similarly, label is an empty string instead of an object. So this is invalid JSON structure. 

Similarly, analysis_4 in predicted has analysis_data as "", which should be an array. So these entries have structural issues. 

Other analyses like analysis_6,8,14 also have empty fields. For example analysis_6 has analysis_name "", training_set "", label "". These are invalid structures because the keys exist but their values are not valid (like empty string instead of array/object).

Therefore, the structure is flawed in several places. 

How many analyses are problematic? Let's count:

Analyses in ground truth: 17 (analysis_1 to analysis_17)

In predicted: 17 as well (analysis_1 to analysis_17). Wait checking:

Ground truth analyses count to analysis_17 (17 items). Predicted also has analysis_1 to analysis_17 (17 items). 

Now checking each analysis for structure validity:

Analysis_1: looks okay (has analysis_name, analysis_data array).

Analysis_2: okay (label is object with NPC array).

Analysis_3: analysis_name is empty string, training_set is "", label is "". So invalid structure. Should be arrays or objects. Training_set should be array, but it's a string. Similarly, label is an empty string instead of an object with array.

Analysis_4: analysis_name empty, analysis_data is "", which should be an array. So invalid.

Analysis_5: okay (has analysis_name, training_set array, label).

Analysis_6: analysis_name empty, training_set "", label "". Invalid.

Analysis_7: okay (analysis_data is array, label has prognosis array).

Analysis_8: analysis_name "", training_set "", label "". Invalid.

Analysis_9: okay (analysis_data array, label has empty key but array ["Tumor", "Normal"]—the key is empty string which may be an issue, but ground truth has "label": {"": [...]}. So that's okay as per ground truth's structure. Wait in ground truth analysis_9: "label": {"": ["Tumor", "Normal"]}, so the key is empty string. Predicted does the same, so that's okay.

Analysis_10: okay (analysis_data array).

Analysis_11: okay.

Analysis_12: okay.

Analysis_13: "data" instead of "analysis_data"? Wait in ground truth, analysis_13 has "data": ["data_5"], while in predicted, it's the same. So structure-wise, the key is "data" which is allowed (ground truth uses "data" here). So okay.

Analysis_14: analysis_name is "", analysis_data is "", label is "". So invalid structure.

Analysis_15: okay.

Analysis_16: okay.

Analysis_17: okay.

So invalid analyses are: 3,4,6,8,14. Total 5 analyses with structural issues. Out of 17, that's about 29%. So structure score: maybe 71 (since 12/17 are okay?), but it's more nuanced. Each problematic analysis deducts points. Since structure requires all objects to be valid JSON, any invalid entry brings down the structure score. 

If even one analysis has invalid structure, the entire component's structure isn't valid. Wait, the structure criteria says "Confirm that the component is valid JSON." So if any analysis within the analyses array has invalid JSON (like having a string where an array is expected), then the entire component's structure is invalid. So the structure score would be 0? That can't be right. Maybe partial credit?

Alternatively, maybe check if the entire component is valid JSON. Let's see: in predicted, the analyses array contains objects like analysis_3 with "training_set": "" which is a string, but in ground truth it's an array. So in JSON, that's valid but structurally incorrect. The JSON itself is valid (no syntax errors), but the key-value structure is wrong. The structure requirement says "Verify that each object follows a proper key–value structure." So improper types (like using string instead of array) would make the structure invalid. Thus, the structure score is penalized for each such instance.

Assuming each invalid analysis deducts, say, 5 points (since 17 total), then 5* (5/17≈30%) → structure score ~70? Or maybe the structure is considered invalid as a whole if any entry is wrong, leading to lower score. This is ambiguous, but let's assume partial deductions.

Perhaps the structure is mostly okay except for those 5 analyses. Let's give structure a score of 65 (penalizing 35% for 5 out of 17 entries having structural issues).

Next, Accuracy:

Compare each analysis in predicted with ground truth.

Starting with analysis_1: matches (name Correlation, data references correct datasets).

Analysis_2: same as ground truth (ROC, data_1-3, label NPC True/False).

Analysis_3 in ground truth is MLGenie with training_set data1-3 and label NPC. Predicted has empty name, training_set as "", label "". So completely wrong. So this analysis is inaccurate.

Analysis_4 in ground truth is Functional Enrichment Analysis on analysis_2. Predicted analysis_4 has empty name and data. So wrong.

Analysis_5: matches (Survival Analysis on data4, label expression High/Low).

Analysis_6 in ground truth is univariate Cox regression on data4 and analysis5, with label prognostic risk. Predicted analysis_6 has empty name and data. So wrong.

Analysis_7 matches (ROC on analysis6, label prognosis).

Analysis_8 in ground truth is univariate Cox on data4 and analysis5, label survival. Predicted analysis8 has empty fields, so wrong.

Analysis_9 matches (Differential on data4, label with Tumor/Normal).

Analysis_10 matches (Functional Enrichment on data5).

Analysis_11 matches (immune cells on data5).

Analysis_12 matches (Differential on analysis11, Risk low/high).

Analysis_13 matches (TME on data5).

Analysis_14 in ground truth is Differential on analysis13, Risk low/high. Predicted analysis14 has empty fields, so wrong.

Analysis_15 matches (Correlation on data5).

Analysis_16 matches (Correlation on data5 and analysis11).

Analysis_17 matches (Differential on data6 and analysis11, Copy Number labels).

So, out of 17 analyses:

Correct ones: analysis1,2,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17 → 12 correct.

Incorrect: analyses 3,4,6,8,14 → 5 incorrect.

Accuracy: 12/17 ≈ 70.5%.

But some may have partial correctness? Like analysis_3 in predicted has empty fields, so no accuracy. So 70.5% accuracy.

Completeness: Must cover all ground truth analyses. The predicted has all 17 analyses, but some are incorrect. However, completeness is about presence. Since all are present (count matches), but some are incorrect, but according to instructions, completeness is penalized for missing or extra. Since none missing or extra, completeness is 100? But the incorrect ones aren't semantically equivalent. So completeness is actually 12/17 (since only 12 are correctly present). Wait, the instruction says "Count semantically equivalent objects as valid". So if an analysis exists but is incorrect, it doesn't count toward completeness. 

Thus, completeness would be (number of semantically equivalent analyses)/total in ground truth. So 12/17 ≈70.5%.

Thus, for Analyses component:

Structure: 65 (due to 5 analyses with structural issues)

Accuracy: 70.5%

Completeness: 70.5%

Total score: (65 +70.5+70.5)/3 ≈ 68.7 → ~69.

Wait but maybe structure is more important. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is penalized more. Let me recalculate:

Structure: 65 (because 5 entries are structurally invalid)

Accuracy: 70.5

Completeness:70.5

Total: (65+70.5+70.5)/3 = ~68.7 → 69. Maybe round to 70?

Alternatively, if structure is considered critical, maybe 65 is too harsh. Maybe structure score is 50 (half the analyses have structural issues). Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, the structure is 0 because any invalid entry makes the whole structure invalid. But that seems extreme. Maybe better to say structure is 70 (since 12/17 are okay). 

Alternatively, each analysis contributes to structure. If each analysis must have proper structure, then 12/17 *100 = ~70. So structure is 70.

Then total analyses score: (70+70.5+70.5)/3 ≈70.3 → ~70.

Proceeding to Results.

**Results Component:**

First, Structure:

Check if each result entry is valid JSON and proper key-value. 

Looking at predicted results:

There are 21 entries (ground truth has 20, but maybe an extra?). Let me count:

Ground truth results have 20 entries. 

Predicted results have 21:

Looking at the predicted:

Entries 1-5 (analysis1 metrics), then an empty entry (with all fields empty), then continues. 

The empty entry (like {"analysis_id": "", ...}) is invalid because analysis_id is empty. So that's a structural issue. There are two such entries in predicted:

- The fifth entry: {"analysis_id": "", "metrics": "", "value": "", "features": ""} 

Another empty entry after analysis_5: another empty entry? Let me recount:

Looking at predicted results:

1. analysis1 metrics correlation coeff

2. analysis1 p-value

3. analysis2 AUC

4. analysis2 CI

5. empty (analysis_id is empty)

6. analysis3 95% CI (but analysis_id is empty? Wait no: looking back:

The sixth entry in predicted results is:

{
      "analysis_id": "analysis_3",
      "metrics": "95% confidence interval (CI)",
      "value": "0.583-0.824",
      "features": [...]
}

Wait, after the empty entry (5th), then comes analysis3's entry (6th). Then analysis4, etc. There's another empty entry later:

After analysis_8's entries, there's:

{
      "analysis_id": "",
      "metrics": "",
      "value": "",
      "features": ""
    },
    {
      "analysis_id": "",
      "metrics": "",
      "value": "",
      "features": ""
    }

So two more empty entries. Total of three empty entries in results. Each of these has invalid structure (empty analysis_id). Additionally, the analysis_3 entry in predicted results: in ground truth, analysis3 has an AUC and CI. Predicted's analysis3 entry only has the CI metric. The AUC entry is missing. But that's accuracy/completeness, not structure. 

So for structure, the three empty entries are invalid. The rest seem okay. How many total results entries?

Ground truth has 20 entries. Predicted has 21 (including three empties). The three empties are invalid structurally (because analysis_id is required?). Even if analysis_id is optional, but in ground truth it's always present. 

So structure score: let's see how many are valid. 

Total entries in predicted results: 21. Three are invalid (empty entries). The rest (18) may be okay. But need to check if their keys are properly structured. For example, in ground truth, some results have "metrics" like "p" with array values. The predicted ones seem to match. So structure is mostly okay except for the three empty entries. 

Structure score: (18/21)*100 ≈85.7. But since those three entries are invalid, the component's structure is penalized. Maybe 85.

Accuracy:

Compare each result in predicted with ground truth. 

First, ground truth has 20 entries. Predicted has 21 (three empties plus others). The three empties are extra and irrelevant, so they are penalized for completeness. 

Let's map each non-empty result:

1. analysis1 correlation coeff: matches (values and features).

2. analysis1 p-values: matches.

3. analysis2 AUC: matches.

4. analysis2 CI: matches.

5. analysis3 AUC and CI: in ground truth, analysis3 has two entries (AUC 0.703 and CI). Predicted has only the CI (entry6). So missing the AUC entry for analysis3. 

6. analysis3 CI: correct.

7. analysis4 features: matches.

8. analysis5 p and HR entries: matches.

9. analysis6 has several entries (K-M p, multivariate HR/p, univariate HR (two entries)), and analysis7,8's entries. 

Predicted analysis6 has all those except the analysis3 AUC is missing. The analysis3 entry for AUC is missing in predicted. So analysis3 has one less entry (the AUC one). 

Additionally, in analysis6, the univariate Cox regression HR entry has value "< 0.001" which in ground truth is written as "<0.001"—matches. 

Also, analysis8 has three entries (1yr, 3yr, 5yr OS AUC), which are present in predicted except there's an extra empty entry after analysis8's third entry. 

Wait, let's list all non-empty results in predicted:

Entries 1-4: ok.

Entry5: empty.

Entry6: analysis3's CI.

Entry7: analysis4's features.

Entry8: analysis5's p.

Entry9: empty (another empty? Wait looking back, after analysis5's entries, the next is analysis6's entries:

analysis6 has four entries (K-M p, multivariate HR, multivariate p, univariate HR, univariate HR again). Then analysis7's AUC.

Then analysis8 has three entries (1,3,5 yr OS), then two empty entries.

So total non-empty entries in predicted: let's count:

1. analysis1 corr coeff (1)

2. analysis1 p (2)

3. analysis2 AUC (3)

4. analysis2 CI (4)

5. analysis3 CI (6)

6. analysis4 (7)

7. analysis5 p (8)

8. analysis5 HR (9?)

Wait I'm getting confused. Maybe better to count:

Non-empty entries in predicted results:

1. analysis1 corr coeff

2. analysis1 p

3. analysis2 AUC

4. analysis2 CI

5. analysis3 CI (missing the AUC)

6. analysis4 features

7. analysis5 p

8. analysis5 HR (two entries?)

Wait ground truth analysis5 has two entries (p and HR):

Yes, in ground truth analysis5 has two results (p and HR). Predicted has both.

Then analysis6 has five entries (K-M p, multivariate HR, multivariate p, univariate HR, univariate HR again). In predicted, yes, that's five entries for analysis6.

Analysis7 has one (AUC).

Analysis8 has three entries (1,3,5 yr OS).

Analysis10 has one (features).

Total non-empty entries: 

analysis1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (1), 4 (1), 5 (2), 6 (5), 7 (1), 8 (3), 10 (1). Total: 2+2+1+1+2+5+1+3+1= 18. Plus the three empties, total 21.

Comparing to ground truth's 20 entries, predicted has 18 non-empty but missing one (analysis3's AUC) and has an extra entry? Let's see:

Ground truth analysis3 has two entries (AUC and CI). Predicted has only CI (so missing one).

Thus, total accurate non-empty entries: 17 (18 non-empty minus one missing). 

But some may have inaccuracies. Let's check:

For analysis3: The AUC value is 0.703 in ground truth. In predicted, it's missing. So that's an inaccuracy. The CI entry is correct. So analysis3 is partially accurate but missing a result.

Other entries: most seem accurate except possibly formatting differences (like "0. 371-0.635" vs "0.371-...", but that's minor).

So total accurate entries: For each of the non-empty entries except the missing AUC:

Out of 18 non-empty, 17 are accurate (assuming the rest are correct). So accuracy: (17/20)*100? Wait total in ground truth is 20, but predicted has 18 non-empty (plus three empties). The accurate ones are 18-1 (the missing AUC) =17? So 17/20 =85% accuracy. But also, the extra entries (the three empties are irrelevant, so they count as extra, penalizing accuracy? Or just completeness?)

Wait, the three empty entries are extra and irrelevant, so they reduce completeness. Accuracy is about factual correctness of existing entries. So of the 18 non-empty entries, 17 are correct (missing one AUC), so 17/18≈94% accuracy. But compared to ground truth's 20 entries, the accuracy would be (17)/(20) →85% because they missed one. Hmm, conflicting views.

Alternatively, accuracy is how much the predicted matches ground truth. For each ground truth result, if it's present and correct in predicted, it's accurate. The missing AUC in analysis3 reduces accuracy. The three empties are extra, so they are considered inaccurate.

Total accurate matches: 19 (since predicted has 18 non-empty, missing one AUC, so 19-1=18? Not sure.)

This is getting complicated. Let's approximate:

The main inaccuracies are:

- Missing analysis3's AUC (one entry).

- Extra three empty entries (irrelevant).

Thus, accuracy: (number of correct entries / total ground truth entries) → (19/20)=95% minus the extra entries' impact? Not sure. Alternatively, since the extra entries are wrong, they subtract from accuracy. So total correct entries are 19 (ground truth has 20, predicted has 19 correct but one missing and three extra). So accuracy is (19 - 3)/20 → (16/20)*100=80. Hmm, unclear. Maybe better to say accuracy is around 85%.

Completeness: Must cover all ground truth results. They missed the analysis3 AUC, so 19/20 complete →95%, but also added three irrelevant entries. The instruction says to penalize for missing or extra. So missing one (penalty) and extra three (penalty). The completeness score would be (20 -1 -3)/20 →16/20=80%? Or perhaps:

Completeness is calculated as (number of correctly covered entries / total ground truth) minus penalty for extra. The formula isn't clear, but likely:

Correctly covered: 19 (since one missing but others present? Wait analysis3's CI is present, but AUC is missing. So 19 correct entries (excluding the missing AUC) but they have three extras. So completeness = (correct_covered / total_ground_truth) →19/20 =95, but with extra entries, so maybe 95 - (3/20)*100 → 95-15=80. 

Alternatively, the completeness is (correct_covered - extra)/total → (19-3)/20 →16/20=80. 

Thus, Completeness: 80%

Structure: 85 (from earlier estimate)

Accuracy: 85%

Completeness:80%

Total Results score: (85+85+80)/3 ≈83.3 → ~83.

Putting it all together:

Data: 89

Analyses: ~70

Results: ~83

Final scores:

Data: 89

Analyses: 70

Results: 83

But need to double-check.

Wait for Analyses, earlier thought structure was 70, accuracy and completeness each ~70, so total 70.

Results: 85+85+80 /3 ≈83.

So the final scores would be:

Data: ~89

Analyses:70

Results:83

But let me recheck Analyses Structure. If 5 analyses are structurally invalid (each having wrong data types), then perhaps structure is 12/17 (~70). So the analyses score is (70+70.5+70.5)/3≈70.

Yes, so final JSON would be:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 89,
        "Analyses": 70,
        "Results": 83
    }
}

Wait but maybe the Data score is lower because data_5 was completely wrong. Let me recheck Data's accuracy. 

Data_5 in ground truth has omics="RNA-seq", source="LinkedOmics", public_id="TCGA-HNSCC". Predicted has omics empty, source empty, public_id empty, format "txt". So all key elements are wrong. That's a complete miss for Data_5. Thus, accuracy for Data: 5/6 entries correct → ~83.3. Completeness also 83.3. So total Data score average of 100,83.3,83.3 → (100+83.3+83.3)/3= 88.9 → rounded to 89.

Analyses: Structure 70, Accuracy 70.5, Completeness70.5 → 70.

Results: Structure 85, Accuracy85, Completeness80 → (85+85+80)/3=83.3→83.

Final scores as above.

{
    "Final Scores": {

### Explanation of Scores:

#### **Data Component (89/100):**
- **Structure (100/100):** All data entries are valid JSON with correct key-value pairs.
- **Accuracy (83/100):** Five of six entries are fully accurate. The sixth entry (`data_5`) is entirely incorrect (missing `omics`, `source`, `public_id`, and mismatched `format`), reducing accuracy by ~17%.
- **Completeness (83/100):** All six entries are present, but one is semantically invalid (`data_5`). This reduces completeness by ~17%.

---

#### **Analyses Component (70/100):**
- **Structure (70/100):** Five analyses (`analysis_3`, `analysis_4`, `analysis_6`, `analysis_8`, `analysis_14`) have structural flaws (e.g., empty arrays/objects replaced with strings). This reduces the score by ~30%.
- **Accuracy (70/100):** Twelve of seventeen analyses are fully accurate. Five analyses are structurally/semantically incorrect (e.g., `analysis_3` lacks critical details), reducing accuracy by ~30%.
- **Completeness (70/100):** All seventeen analyses are present, but five are invalid. This reduces completeness by ~30%.

---

#### **Results Component (83/100):**
- **Structure (85/100):** Three empty entries with invalid `analysis_id` values reduce the score slightly (~15% penalty).
- **Accuracy (85/100):** Nineteen of twenty ground-truth results are accurate, but one result (`analysis_3`’s AUC) is missing, reducing accuracy by ~8%.
- **Completeness (80/100):** All twenty ground-truth results are covered except one (`analysis_3`’s AUC). Three irrelevant empty entries further reduce completeness by ~20%.
