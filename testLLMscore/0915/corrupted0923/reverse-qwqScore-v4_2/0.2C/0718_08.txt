Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component:**

Looking at the ground truth Data array, there are five entries. The predicted Data also has five entries. Let me compare them one by one.

- **data_1 (Ground Truth):**
  - omics: Metabolomics
  - source: EMBL-EBI MetaboLights
  - link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/
  - public_id: MTBLS7337
  - format: (empty)

  **Predicted data_1:**
  - omics: empty
  - source: empty
  - link: empty
  - format: raw files
  - public_id: empty

  So, the predicted version misses the omics type, source, link, and public_id. Only format is mentioned as "raw files", but in GT, format is empty. That's incorrect because GT doesn't have that info. So this is a problem. Deduct points here.

- **data_2 (GT):**
  - omics: Proteomics
  - source: EBI ProteomeXchange
  - link: https://peptideatlas.org/
  - public_id: PASS03810
  - format: empty

  **Predicted data_2:**
  - omics: empty
  - source: empty
  - link: empty
  - format: Mendeley Data Portal
  - public_id: empty

  Again, omics, source, link, public_id are missing. Format is "Mendeley Data Portal", which isn't in GT. So another deduction here.

- **data_3 (Both):**
  Both have the same omics ("Multiplexed cytokine assays"), same source, link (empty), etc. So this is accurate and complete. Good.

- **data_4 and data_5 (GT and Predicted):**
  For both data_4 and data_5, the omics types (Proteomics and Metabolomics) match. The links are the same. The source and public_id are empty in both. So these are correct.

So for Data:

Structure: All entries have valid JSON? Let me check. In the predicted data, the keys seem properly structured except maybe the order, but that's irrelevant. No syntax errors noticed. So structure is okay.

Accuracy: The first two data entries in predicted miss critical info (omics, sources, etc.) which are present in GT. The format fields in data_1 and data_2 in predicted are incorrect. The other three are accurate. 

Completeness: The predicted has all the required entries (five items). But data_1 and data_2 lack necessary details, making them incomplete. So completeness is lacking here.

Scoring: Maybe 60? Let's think. Structure is fine (100). Accuracy is low because the first two entries are wrong. Completeness is also affected since those entries are incomplete. Maybe around 60 for Accuracy and Completeness, leading to an overall Data score of 60? Or lower?

Wait, maybe more precise breakdown. Accuracy: 3 correct entries (data_3,4,5) out of 5. But data_1 and 2 have some correct parts? No, they have almost nothing right except maybe the ID. The omics type is crucial. So maybe Accuracy is 3/5 * 100 = 60%. Completeness: All entries exist (5/5), but some are incomplete. How to weight that? Since completeness considers coverage of relevant objects, but here the objects themselves are incomplete. So maybe completeness is also around 60? So total Data score around 60. Let me note possible deductions.

---

**Analyses Component:**

Ground truth has 7 analyses, while predicted has 7 as well. Let's go through each.

**analysis_1:**
- Both have "Metabolomics" as analysis_name and analysis_data as data_1. Correct.

**analysis_2:**
- Both "Proteomics" and data_2. Correct.

**analysis_3 (Note: In GT it's " analysis_3" with a space before id, but in predicted also same typo?) Wait, looking back:

Ground truth analysis_3's id is written as " analysis_3" (with leading space?), which might be an error. Similarly in predicted. But according to the instructions, IDs are just identifiers so typos might be ignored. Assuming the space is a typo but the rest matches. The analysis name "PCA" matches. analysis_data in both includes analysis_1, analysis_2, data_3. Correct.

**analysis_4 (GT):**
- Name: Differential analysis
- analysis_data: [analysis_1, analysis_2, data_3]
- label: {Infection: ["Acute", "Control"]}

Predicted analysis_4:
Same as above. So accurate.

**analysis_5 (GT):**
- ID analysis_5, name "Differential analysis", data same as analysis_4, label {Infection: ["Convalescence", "Acute"]}

In predicted analysis_5:
Name is empty, analysis_data is empty, label is empty. This is completely missing. So this entry is wrong.

**analysis_6 (GT):**
- Name: Functional Enrichment Analysis
- analysis_data: [analysis_4]

Predicted analysis_6:
Name is empty, analysis_data is empty. Missing entirely.

**analysis_7 (GT and Predicted):**
Both have "Classification Analysis". Training set and label look similar. In GT, the label key is "adverse clinical outcomes...", which is correctly captured in predicted. So this is accurate.

So in Analyses:

Structure: Check JSON validity. In GT analysis_3 has a space in the id, but that's allowed as per JSON. Predicted seems valid too. So structure is okay.

Accuracy: analysis_5 and 6 are missing their details in predicted. analysis_5 is entirely incorrect (empty name, data, label). analysis_6 is similarly empty. The rest are correct. So out of 7 analyses, 5 are correct (analysis1-4,7), but analysis5 and 6 are wrong. However, analysis_5 in GT has different labels compared to analysis_4. The predicted analysis5 is empty, so that's wrong. analysis6 is also empty where GT had "Functional Enrichment".

Accuracy: 5 correct (if considering analysis_5 and 6 as zero, then 5/7 ≈71% accuracy. But actually analysis_5 and 6 in predicted are incorrect, so accuracy would be 5/7? Wait, analysis_3 is correct, yes. So maybe 5/7? Hmm, but analysis_5 in GT is present but predicted has no info, so that's inaccurate. Similarly for analysis6.

Completeness: The predicted has all 7 entries, but two of them (analysis5 and 6) have missing essential fields. So completeness is penalized for those two being incomplete. Also, since the analyses are present but incomplete, maybe completeness is around 5/7 (since 2 are incomplete), but maybe the presence counts but the content doesn't. The instructions say to count semantically equivalent objects. Since analysis5 and 6 in predicted are empty, they don't match GT's versions. Thus, completeness might be 5/7 (only 5 correct objects?), so about 71% but with penalties.

Wait, the completeness is about covering the relevant objects. If the analysis5 and 6 in predicted are present but their content is wrong, does that count as covered? The instruction says "count semantically equivalent objects as valid, even if wording differs." But here, the content is entirely missing, so they aren't equivalent. So completeness would deduct for having two incomplete entries (or missing their correct content). Alternatively, maybe the existence of analysis5 and 6 is there but their attributes are wrong, so they are present but not accurate. Thus, completeness is full (all 7 entries exist), but their content is wrong affecting accuracy. 

Hmm, perhaps the scoring is split between accuracy and completeness. So completeness is about presence of the object (regardless of its content), whereas accuracy is about the content's correctness. Wait, let me re-read the criteria.

Completeness: "Measure how well the predicted annotation covers relevant objects present in the ground truth. Count semantically equivalent objects as valid, even if the wording differs. Penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects."

Ah, so completeness is about whether all objects from GT are present (or semantically equivalent), and extra objects are penalized. 

In Analyses:

GT has 7 analyses. Predicted has 7. So no extras. But in terms of content, analysis5 and 6 in predicted have empty fields, so are they considered equivalent? No, because their attributes (like analysis_name, labels) are missing, making them not equivalent to GT's analysis5 and 6. Therefore, completeness would penalize for missing those objects (since their content isn't present). So effectively, the predicted has 5 correct objects (analysis1-4,7), and 2 missing (analysis5 and 6). Hence completeness is 5/7 ≈71%.

Accuracy: For the existing objects:

Analysis1-4 and 7 are accurate except maybe analysis5 and 6. Wait, analysis5 and 6 in predicted are empty, so their accuracy is 0. 

Calculating accuracy:

Total accurate objects: 5 (analysis1-4,7) plus analysis5 and 6 are 0. So 5/7≈71% accuracy. But maybe analysis_3's ID typo doesn't matter. 

Thus, accuracy ~71%, completeness ~71%. But structure is perfect. 

Therefore, the Analyses score might be around 70-75? Maybe 70 for accuracy, 70 for completeness, so total around 70? Or higher?

Alternatively, if structure is 100, then:

Accuracy: 5/7 (correct analyses) → ~71, but considering analysis_3's ID typo (leading space), but instructions say IDs are unique identifiers, so mismatches in ID don't matter unless content changes. Wait, in the predicted, the analysis_3's ID is also " analysis_3" with leading space, same as GT. So that's okay. So no issue there. 

Another point: analysis_5 in GT has a different label (Infection: Convalescence vs Acute), whereas predicted analysis5 has nothing. So that's a loss. analysis_6 is missing its analysis name and data. So for accuracy, the 5 correct analyses (excluding 5 and 6) give 5/7, so maybe 70 accuracy. Completeness also 5/7, so same. So overall maybe 70.

But maybe the analysis_5 and 6 are still present as objects, so completeness is 100 (all objects present), but their content is wrong, affecting accuracy. 

Wait the instructions say "count semantically equivalent objects as valid". So if an object exists but has wrong content, it's counted as present for completeness but inaccurate. So completeness is 100 (all objects present), but accuracy is penalized for their inaccuracy. 

Ah! That’s an important distinction. Completeness is about presence of the object (regardless of content), while accuracy is about content correctness. 

So for Analyses:

Completeness: 7/7 = 100% (all objects present).

Accuracy: For each object:

analysis_1: accurate (100%)
analysis_2: accurate (100%)
analysis_3: accurate (100%)
analysis_4: accurate (100%)
analysis_5: content is empty, so 0% accuracy
analysis_6: content is empty, 0%
analysis_7: accurate (100%)

Total accurate points: 5/7 objects fully accurate (analysis1-4,7). analysis5 and 6 contribute 0. So accuracy is (5*100 + 2*0)/7 ≈71.4%. So 71.4 accuracy. Structure is 100. So the accuracy score is 71, completeness is 100. So total score would be more like 85? Because structure is full, completeness is full, but accuracy is 71. Maybe the overall Analyses score is around 85? Wait, but the three criteria are each part of the component's score. The problem says to assign a score (0-100) for each component based on structure, accuracy, completeness. 

Wait, the instructions for scoring criteria say each component's score is based on the three aspects: structure, accuracy, completeness. So each component (Data, Analyses, Results) has their own scores, considering all three aspects. 

Hmm, the user probably wants each component scored as a whole, considering the three aspects. So for Analyses:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, proper keys).

Accuracy: 71.4% (as above)

Completeness: 100% (all objects present)

So the component score would be weighted average? Or how?

The instructions say "assign a separate score (0-100) for each of the three components. The score for each component is based on three evaluation aspects: 1. Structure, 2. Accuracy, 3. Completeness".

It might mean that the component's score is a composite of the three aspects. But the user hasn't specified weights. So perhaps we have to consider all three factors holistically. 

Since Structure is perfect (100), and Completeness is 100, but Accuracy is 71, then the Analyses score might be around 85? Because 71 + 100 +100 averaged? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each aspect contributes equally, so (100 +71 +100)/3 ≈ 93.66? But that might be high. 

Alternatively, the user might expect us to use the three aspects as separate considerations and combine them into a single score. Since structure is fine, and completeness is good, but accuracy is lower, maybe around 80? Let me think again.

Alternatively, the total score could be calculated by considering all aspects. For example:

If structure is 100, then that's full marks. Accuracy and completeness each contribute to the remaining. Suppose each aspect has equal weight, so each is worth 1/3 of the total. So:

Structure: 100 → 100*(1/3)=33.3

Accuracy: 71.4 → 71.4*(1/3)=23.8

Completeness: 100 → 33.3

Total: 33.3+23.8+33.3= 90.4 → ~90. 

Alternatively, maybe the three aspects are considered multiplicatively? Like (structure_score * accuracy_score * completeness_score)^(1/3)? Not sure. The instructions are unclear on how to combine them. 

Alternatively, the user might want each aspect's score to be evaluated and then the component score is an overall assessment considering all. 

Given that structure is perfect, completeness is perfect, but accuracy is around 71, I'll estimate the Analyses score as 80-85. Let's say 80.

Wait, but let me check again. The accuracy is 71 (from 5/7), but maybe some of the analyses have partial accuracy. For example, analysis_5 in predicted has analysis_data as empty, but in GT it's analysis_4 etc. So that's wrong. But if the analysis's name and other fields are empty, it's entirely wrong. So analysis_5 and 6 are 0% accurate. 

Alternatively, maybe analysis_6 in predicted is supposed to be "Functional Enrichment" but is missing. So that's a big loss. 

Perhaps the accuracy is lower than 71. Let me see:

Each analysis's contribution to accuracy:

analysis1: 100%

analysis2: 100%

analysis3: 100%

analysis4: 100%

analysis5: 0% (all fields wrong)

analysis6: 0%

analysis7: 100%

Total accurate objects: 5, total 7. So 5/7 is ~71.4% accuracy. So perhaps 71 for accuracy, completeness 100, structure 100. 

Assuming equal weighting, total would be (100+100+71)/3 ≈ 93.6, but that might be too high. Alternatively, the user might expect that if one aspect is lower, it drags down the score more. 

Alternatively, maybe the overall component score is the minimum of the three aspects, but that might be too harsh. 

Alternatively, the user might want to treat each aspect's impact differently. Since structure is essential, but if it's perfect, then it doesn't subtract. Accuracy and completeness are both important. 

Maybe the Analyses score is around 80. Let's tentatively say 80 for now. Need to see other sections.

---

**Results Component:**

Ground truth has 6 results entries, predicted has 5. Wait, let me check:

Ground truth Results:
- 5 entries (analysis_4 once, analysis_7 five times (but in the provided data, looking at the JSON, actually 5 entries under results: analysis_4 has one, analysis_7 has four? Wait no, let me recount:

Looking at the Ground Truth Results array:

First entry: analysis_4, features list.

Then five entries for analysis_7 (metrics: AUC, accuracy, recall, F1, precision). Wait, no, the Ground Truth's results array has six entries:

Wait let me recount the ground truth:

Looking at the original ground truth's "results" section:

There are six entries:

1. analysis_4 (features)
2. analysis_7 (AUC)
3. analysis_7 (accuracy)
4. analysis_7 (recall)
5. analysis_7 (F1)
6. analysis_7 (precision)

Yes, 6 entries. 

The predicted Results array has 5 entries:

Looking at the predicted results array:

- analysis_4 (features)
- analysis_7 (AUC)
- analysis_7 (accuracy)
- analysis_7 (recall)
- analysis_7 (F1)
- analysis_7 (precision)

Wait, the predicted has exactly the same 6 entries as GT. Wait, in the user's input for predicted, under results, the last entry is "precision", so that's 5 entries for analysis_7 plus the first, totaling 6. So same count.

Now comparing each:

**analysis_4 (GT and Predicted):**

Features are the same: ["thrombospondin-1", "glutamine", "serotonin", "sCD40L"]. So accurate and complete.

**analysis_7 entries:**

For each metric (AUC, accuracy, etc.), the metrics names match. Values are the same (like [0.83,0.86...] and [0.75,0.83] etc.). Features lists also match exactly. 

So all results entries are accurate and complete. 

Structure: The JSON structure looks valid. All entries have proper keys. The arrays and values are correctly formatted. So structure is 100.

Accuracy: All entries match GT. So 100% accuracy.

Completeness: All 6 entries are present and correct. So 100% completeness.

Thus, Results component should get 100.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any discrepancies?

Looking at the predicted's analysis_7's features for metrics like precision:

In GT, precision has value [1.00, 0.71], and predicted has [1.0, 0.71]. The trailing .0 is omitted but numerically same. So acceptable. Similarly for other numbers. Formatting differences (like 0.8 instead of 0.80) but the values are same. So accurate.

No missing entries. So Results is perfect. 

---

**Final Scores Summary:**

Data: 

- Structure: Valid JSON. All entries have proper keys. The first two entries have missing data but that's about content, not structure. So structure is 100.

- Accuracy: The first two data entries are mostly empty where GT had info. The third onward are correct. 

Looking at Data's accuracy: 

Out of 5 entries:

- data_1: 0% (no omics/source/link/public_id)
- data_2: 0% (same issues)
- data_3: 100%
- data_4: 100%
- data_5: 100%

Total accurate points: 3/5 = 60% accuracy. 

Completeness: All entries exist (5/5), but first two are incomplete. However, completeness counts presence of the object. Since all five are present, completeness is 100. But the problem states "penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects". Since they are present but incomplete, does that affect completeness? 

Ah, the instructions for completeness: "Count semantically equivalent objects as valid, even if the wording differs. Penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects."

The first two entries in data are present but their attributes are missing, making them incomplete. But since the objects (data_1, data_2, etc.) are present, they are counted as present. So completeness is 100. The penalty comes from the content (accuracy), not completeness.

Thus, Data's accuracy is 60, structure 100, completeness 100. 

Assuming equal weighting, the Data score would be (100 + 60 + 100)/3 = 90. But that might be too high because accuracy is low. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that if accuracy is 60, and completeness is 100, the overall is closer to 80? 

Alternatively, structure is perfect, so that's 100. Then the combined accuracy and completeness (each 100 and 60?) but perhaps they are separate factors. The problem says "assign a separate score (0-100) for each of the three components based on the three evaluation aspects". It might mean that each component's score is a holistic number considering all three aspects. 

Alternatively, maybe each aspect is considered and deducted from 100. For Data:

- Structure: 100 (no issues)
- Accuracy: 60 (3/5 entries accurate)
- Completeness: 100 (all entries present)

Overall Data score might be 80 (average of 100,60,100 = 86.66?), but maybe the user wants to prioritize accuracy. 

Alternatively, the deduction approach: The maximum possible is 100. For Data, accuracy is the weakest at 60. So maybe 80 (100 minus 20% for accuracy). 

Hmm, hard to know without explicit weights. To be safe, perhaps:

Data score: 

Accuracy is 60, so that's the main drag. Since structure and completeness are perfect, but accuracy is 60, maybe the overall is around 80? 

Alternatively, since accuracy is 60% of the component's accuracy part, and completeness is 100, perhaps the total is 80 (assuming equal parts: (60 + 100 + 100)/3 ≈ 86.6 → rounded to 85). 

Alternatively, the user might consider that the two bad data entries (data_1 and 2) are 40% of the total data entries (2/5). So the data's overall score is 60 (since 2 were 0 and 3 were 100). 

Since the instructions mention "gap-based scoring", meaning the score is 100 minus the percentage gap. 

For Data:

Accuracy gap is 40% (since 60% accurate). So 60.

Completeness gap: 0% (full). So 100.

Structure: 100.

Total component score would average these three? Or maybe the component score is the minimum? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the component score is the average of the three aspects. (60 + 100 + 100)/3 = 86.6 → 87.

But since the user wants separate scores for each component, maybe it's better to calculate each aspect's impact:

The main issue is accuracy at 60, so the component score can't be higher than that. Maybe 70? 

Alternatively, since structure and completeness are perfect, but accuracy is 60, the final score could be 80 (allowing some credit for structure and completeness). 

This is a bit ambiguous, but I'll proceed with 80 for Data.

Analyses: As discussed earlier, around 80-85. Let's say 80.

Results: 100.

So final scores would be:

Data: 80,

Analyses: 80,

Results: 100.

Wait, but maybe Analyses' accuracy was 71 (due to two out of seven entries being wrong). So 70 for accuracy, completeness 100, structure 100. So (70 + 100 + 100)/3 ≈ 93.3? No, that can't be right. Wait, the Analyses' accuracy was 71% (5/7). 

If the three aspects are each 1/3 weight:

Structure:100 → 33.3

Accuracy:71 →23.7

Completeness:100 →33.3

Total: 33.3 +23.7 +33.3 = 90.3 → 90.

Alternatively, maybe the user thinks that since the two analyses (5 and 6) are present but their content is wrong, their accuracy is 0, but they are counted in completeness. So the Analyses score would be:

Accuracy: 5/7 ≈71.4 → 71,

Completeness:100,

Structure:100.

So 71 + 100 +100 = 271 / 3 = 90.3 → ~90. 

Hmm. So maybe Analyses score is 90.

But why did I think 80 before? Maybe over-penalizing. Let me recalculate:

If Analyses has 7 entries, and two are entirely wrong (analysis5 and 6 have no content), but they are present, then:

Accuracy per analysis:

Each analysis's accuracy is either 100 or 0. 

Total accuracy points: 5*100 + 2*0 = 500. Total possible 700. → 500/700 = 71.4% accuracy.

Completeness is 100 (all present). 

Structure is 100. 

Thus, the component's score could be an average of 71.4, 100, 100 → 90.3 → ~90. 

So maybe the Analyses score is 90.

Then Data would be 80 (60 accuracy, 100 others → (60+100+100)/3 = 86.6 → rounded to 85 or 80). 

Alternatively, the user might consider that for Data's accuracy, since two out of five entries are completely wrong (data1 and 2), so 40% missing, so accuracy is 60. But structure and completeness are perfect, so maybe overall 80.

So final scores:

Data: 85,

Analyses: 90,

Results:100.

Wait, but I need to ensure consistency.

Alternatively, the user might expect:

Data:

- Structure: 100.

- Accuracy: For each data item, how many fields are correct. 

Looking deeper into Data's accuracy:

For data_1 in GT, the fields are omics, source, link, public_id. The predicted data_1 has omics empty, source empty, link empty, and format "raw files" (which GT didn't have). So none of the critical fields are filled except maybe public_id (also empty in predicted and GT had it). So data_1 has 0% accuracy.

Similarly data_2: same issues. 

data_3: all correct. 

data_4 and 5: correct.

So for each data entry:

data_1: 0% accurate (none of the key fields filled)

data_2: 0%

data_3: 100%

data_4: 100%

data_5: 100%

Total accurate entries: 3/5 → 60% accuracy.

So the accuracy aspect for Data is 60. 

Structure is 100, completeness is 100. 

Assuming the three aspects are equally weighted, the component score is (100 +60+100)/3 = 86.6 → ~87. 

Alternatively, if structure is a binary (either valid or not), which it is, then the other two aspects (accuracy and completeness) each contribute 50% to the score. 

If that's the case, then:

Accuracy (60) + Completeness (100) divided by 2 → (60+100)/2 = 80. 

That might make sense. Since structure is perfect, the remaining 100% is split between accuracy and completeness. 

If that's the approach, then:

Data: (60 +100)/2 = 80.

Analyses: (71.4 +100)/2 = 85.7 → ~86.

Results: (100+100)/2 = 100.

This method might align better. 

Following this logic:

**Data:**
- Accuracy: 60%
- Completeness: 100%
Average (60+100)/2 = 80.

**Analyses:**
- Accuracy: 71.4%
- Completeness: 100%
Average: (71.4+100)/2 ≈ 85.7 → 86.

**Results:**
- Accuracy and completeness both 100 → 100.

So the final scores would be:

Data:80,

Analyses:86,

Results:100.

Alternatively, if the user intended all three aspects to be considered equally (each 1/3), then:

Data: (100 +60+100)/3 = 86.6 → 87.

Analyses: (100+71.4+100)/3≈ 90.4 →90.

Results:100.

Either way, the approximate scores are in that range. Given the ambiguity, I'll go with the first approach where accuracy and completeness are each half the score after structure is met.

So final answer:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 80,
        "Analyses": 85,
        "Results": 100
    }
}

Wait, but let me confirm Analyses calculation again with half weight:

Accuracy:71.4% → 71.4

Completeness:100 → 100

Average: (71.4+100)/2 =85.7→86. 

But maybe round to nearest whole number, so 86.

Alternatively, the user might prefer rounding down to 85.

I think 85 is reasonable.

So final scores as:

Data:80,

Analyses:85,

Results:100.
</think>

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 80,
        "Analyses": 85,
        "Results": 100
    }
}

**Explanation:**

### **Data Component (Score: 80)**
- **Structure**: Valid JSON with proper key-value structures. (100/100)
- **Accuracy**: 
  - 3/5 entries are fully accurate (`data_3`, `data_4`, `data_5`). 
  - `data_1` and `data_2` are missing critical fields (omics type, source, link, public ID) and contain irrelevant format entries. 
  - Accuracy penalty: **40% gap**, resulting in **60/100**.
- **Completeness**: All 5 entries are present (no missing or extra objects). (100/100)
- **Final Score**: Average of Accuracy (60) and Completeness (100) → **80/100**.

---

### **Analyses Component (Score: 85)**
- **Structure**: Valid JSON with proper key-value structures. (100/100)
- **Accuracy**: 
  - 5/7 analyses are fully accurate (`analysis_1` to `analysis_4`, `analysis_7`). 
  - `analysis_5` and `analysis_6` are entirely empty, contributing 0% accuracy. 
  - Accuracy penalty: **~28.6% gap**, resulting in **71.4/100**.
- **Completeness**: All 7 analyses are present (no missing or extra objects). (100/100)
- **Final Score**: Average of Accuracy (~71.4) and Completeness (100) → **85.7 ≈ 86/100** (rounded to 85).

---
