Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data section first.

**Data Component:**

Looking at the ground truth Data array, there are four entries: data_1, data_2, data_3, and data_4. In the predicted annotation, data_3 is missing. The predicted has three entries, so completeness is an issue here. 

Checking structure: All the existing entries in the predicted data have the correct keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). They follow proper JSON structure. The missing data_3 reduces completeness by 25% (since 1 out of 4 is missing). But maybe the penalty isn't exactly 25 because sometimes missing items can have different weightings? Also, the other entries are accurate. So accuracy for existing ones is good except maybe formatting? Wait, the omics for data_4 in the ground truth is "RNA-seq data" while the predicted uses "RNA-seq data"—so that's okay. All the other fields like links, sources, public IDs match. So structure is perfect (100), accuracy for existing entries is 100 since they're correct. The problem is completeness. Since one entry is missing, completeness is 75 (3/4). The overall score would be based on structure (100), accuracy (100), completeness (75). But the scoring criteria says to consider the gap between predicted and ground truth. Maybe the total score for Data would be around 87.5? Wait, but the instructions mention that each component (Data, Analyses, Results) gets its own score, considering all three aspects (structure, accuracy, completeness). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each aspect contributes equally? For example, if structure is 100%, accuracy is 100%, and completeness is 75%, then average would be (100+100+75)/3 = 91.66... But maybe the user wants each aspect weighted equally. Alternatively, maybe structure is a pass/fail? Because if structure is invalid, that's a big issue. But here structure is okay. So for Data:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, correct keys)
Accuracy: 100 (all existing entries match ground truth)
Completeness: 75 (missing one data entry)
Total: (100 + 100 + 75)/3 ≈ 91.67, so maybe rounded to 92? Or perhaps completeness is more heavily weighted? The instructions say "Gap-Based Scoring: Score based on the gap between predicted and ground truth". Since completeness is missing 25%, maybe that's a 20% penalty? Not sure. Alternatively, if completeness is considered critical, maybe the overall score is 75*(some factor). Hmm, this part is a bit unclear, but I'll proceed with 91.67 rounded to 92.

Wait, another thought: maybe the completeness is calculated as (number of correct present items)/(total in GT) plus (no extra items). But the predicted doesn't have any extra items beyond what's in GT except missing one. Since the predicted has exactly the three from GT except missing one, the completeness is 3/4 = 75. So maybe the completeness is 75, and structure and accuracy are 100 each, so total is (100+100+75)/3 = 91.67. So I'll go with 92 for Data.

**Analyses Component:**

Ground truth has 6 analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_6). Predicted has 5 analyses: analysis_1, 2,4,5,6. Missing analysis_3 (Phosphoproteomic analysis linked to data_2). 

First, check structure. All entries in analyses look valid. Keys like id, analysis_name, analysis_data, label are correctly formatted. However, looking at analysis_3's absence, but in predicted, analysis_4 refers to analysis_2 and analysis_3? Wait no: in ground truth analysis_4's analysis_data is ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"], but in predicted analysis_4's analysis_data is also ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"]. But in predicted, analysis_3 is missing. Wait, the predicted's analyses array does not include analysis_3. Wait in predicted analyses list, they have analysis_1, 2, 4, 5,6. So analysis_3 is entirely missing. That's a problem. 

Also, in analysis_4 of predicted, analysis_data references analysis_3 which isn't present in the predicted's analyses. Is that an issue? Since the actual ground truth has analysis_3, but the predicted omitted it, so analysis_4's analysis_data in predicted still has analysis_3 as a dependency, but since that analysis isn't present, maybe that's a structural error? Or does the analysis_data just refer to the data ID which may be in data? Wait, analysis_data can be a list of analysis IDs as per the ground truth. For example, analysis_4 in ground truth has analysis_data as ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"], meaning it depends on those two analyses. But in predicted, analysis_3 is not present, so the analysis_data in analysis_4 still includes analysis_3 which is missing. That might be an inconsistency. However, according to the ground truth, the analysis_3 exists, so the predicted should have included it. Therefore, missing analysis_3 is a completeness issue. 

So completeness for Analyses: 5/6 entries, which is ~83.3%. 

Accuracy: The existing analyses (except analysis_3) are present. Check each entry:

Analysis_1: matches (WES analysis pointing to data_3). Wait wait, in ground truth analysis_1's analysis_data is "data_3", which is correct. In predicted, analysis_1's analysis_data is "data_3". But in the predicted data array, data_3 is missing! Wait, hold on, in the predicted data array, there is no data_3. The data_3 in ground truth is the WES data. Since the predicted data array lacks data_3, then in the analyses, analysis_1 references data_3 which is not present in the data array. That's an inconsistency. Wait, this is a problem. 

Oh wait, this is a mistake. The predicted's data array does not include data_3 (the WES data). So analysis_1 in predicted refers to data_3 which is not present in the data array. That's an error in accuracy because the analysis_data should reference existing data entries. Therefore, analysis_1's analysis_data is incorrect (since data_3 is missing from data). That's a problem. 

So in the predicted's analysis_1, analysis_data is "data_3", but in their data array, data_3 isn't there. Therefore, this is an accuracy issue for analysis_1. Similarly, analysis_6 in predicted has analysis_data as ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"], but analysis_3 is missing, so that's also a problem. 

Hmm, this complicates things. So the predicted analysis_1's analysis_data points to data_3 which isn't in their data array. That's a factual inaccuracy because the analysis_data must correspond to existing data entries. Therefore, analysis_1 is inaccurate. 

Let me retrace:

Ground Truth Analysis_1: analysis_data is data_3 (which exists in data array). 

In predicted's data array, data_3 is missing. Hence, analysis_1's analysis_data references a non-existent data entry, making that analysis entry inaccurate. 

Similarly, analysis_4 in predicted has analysis_data as ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"], but analysis_3 is missing, so that analysis_4's data references an analysis that doesn't exist. So that's also inaccurate. 

Therefore, some analyses are incorrect because they reference non-existent data/analyses. 

This complicates the accuracy score. 

Let's break down each analysis in predicted:

Analysis_1:
- analysis_data: "data_3" → but data_3 is missing in data array → this is wrong. So this analysis entry is incorrect. 

Analysis_2: 
- analysis_data is "data_1" → which exists. Correct. 

Analysis_4:
- analysis_data: ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"] → analysis_3 is missing → so the second element is invalid. But in ground truth, analysis_3 exists. So this analysis is partially correct but referencing an invalid analysis. 

Analysis_5:
- analysis_data: "analysis_4" → which exists in predicted (since analysis_4 is present), so that's okay. 

Analysis_6:
- analysis_data: ["analysis_2", "analysis_3"] → again, analysis_3 is missing, so invalid reference. 

Additionally, the missing analysis_3 (Phosphoproteomic analysis linked to data_2) is entirely absent. 

So accuracy issues:

For analysis_1: incorrect (because data_3 not present)
Analysis_4: partially incorrect (references analysis_3)
Analysis_6: partially incorrect (references analysis_3)
Analysis_3 is missing entirely, so that's a completeness loss.

Calculating accuracy:

Total analyses in ground truth: 6. 

Number of analyses in predicted: 5 (missing analysis_3)

But among the existing 5 in predicted:

Analysis_1: inaccurate (due to data_3 missing)
Analysis_2: accurate
Analysis_4: partially accurate (but references analysis_3 which is missing)
Analysis_5: accurate
Analysis_6: partially accurate (references analysis_3)

Hmm, tricky. Maybe each analysis must have all their dependencies present and correct. 

Alternatively, if the analysis entry itself is present but has an incorrect data link, it's considered inaccurate. 

For example:

Analysis_1: the analysis entry exists but its analysis_data points to a non-existent data → so it's inaccurate. 

Analysis_4: the analysis entry exists but references analysis_3 which is missing → so the analysis_data is incorrect. 

Analysis_6 similarly. 

So let's count:

Out of the 5 analyses in predicted:

- Analysis_2 and Analysis_5 are accurate. 

Analysis_1,4,6 are inaccurate due to bad references. 

Plus the missing analysis_3. 

Total accurate analyses in predicted: 2 (analysis_2 and 5). 

The other three (analysis_1,4,6) have accuracy issues. 

So accuracy score for analyses would be (2/5)*100 = 40? But that seems harsh. Alternatively, maybe partial credit. 

Alternatively, each analysis's accuracy is whether its contents (excluding dependencies?) are correct. Wait, but the analysis_data is part of the analysis's content. So if analysis_data is wrong, that's part of accuracy. 

Alternatively, maybe the name and the data links must be correct. 

For analysis_1:

Name is "WES analysis", which is correct (matches GT's analysis_1's name). But the analysis_data is wrong (data_3 is missing). So partially accurate?

Hmm, this is getting complex. Perhaps better to approach each analysis:

Analysis_1 (WES analysis):

GT has analysis_data as data_3. In predicted's data array, data_3 is missing. Thus, the analysis_data in analysis_1 is invalid. So this analysis entry is incorrect (0 accuracy for this entry).

Analysis_2 (proteomic analysis): 

Correct, analysis_data is data_1 which exists. Accurate.

Analysis_4 (differential gene expression):

GT analysis_data is analysis_2 and analysis_3. In predicted, analysis_4's analysis_data is analysis_2 and analysis_3 (even though analysis_3 is missing). The names and structure are correct except for the missing dependency. But the analysis itself (the entry's name and data fields) are correct except the data references an invalid analysis. So this entry is partially accurate? Or not?

If the analysis_3 is missing, then the analysis_data in analysis_4 is invalid, making the analysis_4 entry's analysis_data incorrect. So this is inaccurate. 

Analysis_5 (Pathway enrichment):

Points to analysis_4, which exists. So accurate. 

Analysis_6 (Survival analysis):

References analysis_2 and analysis_3. Since analysis_3 is missing, the analysis_data is invalid. So this entry is inaccurate. 

Thus, out of the 5 analyses in predicted:

Only analysis_2 and analysis_5 are fully accurate. The others have inaccuracies. 

Plus, analysis_3 is missing, so completeness is 5/6 (~83.3%). 

Accuracy: (2 accurate entries / total 6 in GT) * (something)? Wait, no. Accuracy per aspect is about how accurately the predicted matches the ground truth. Since the predicted has 5 analyses, but 3 of them have errors in their data fields, maybe the accuracy is (2/5)*100 = 40? 

Alternatively, maybe each analysis's accuracy is judged on its own correctness. 

Each analysis in predicted:

- analysis_1: 0 (wrong data)
- analysis_2: 100
- analysis_4: 0 (due to analysis_3 ref)
- analysis_5: 100
- analysis_6: 0 (due to analysis_3 ref)

Total accurate analyses: 2 (analysis_2 and 5). 

Total possible in GT: 6. So accuracy is (2/6)*100 = ~33.3%. But that might be too low. Alternatively, considering that the structure is correct, but the references are wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the name and the data references must both be correct. For analysis_4, the name is correct (diff expr analysis) but data is wrong. So half marks? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the accuracy is determined by whether the analysis entry is semantically equivalent. Since the analysis_4 in predicted is supposed to be the differential gene expression analysis using analysis_2 and analysis_3, but since analysis_3 is missing, the entry is incomplete but the name is correct. Maybe 50% for that? 

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I'll proceed with an approximate score. 

Structural score for analyses: All entries are valid JSON, keys are correct. So structure is 100.

Accuracy: The analyses that are present have some inaccuracies due to missing dependencies. Since 3 out of 5 analyses in predicted have data references that are invalid (because their dependencies are missing), the accuracy might be around 40% (2/5 correct). Plus, the missing analysis_3 reduces completeness. 

Alternatively, considering that the analysis_4's name and label are correct except the data references, maybe it's partially correct. 

Overall, the accuracy score for Analyses might be around 60. 

Completeness: 5/6 entries present, so 83.3. 

Total score: (100 + 60 + 83.3)/3 ≈ 81.1 → ~81. 

But this is rough. Maybe structure is 100, accuracy 50 (since half the entries have issues), completeness 83. Then (100+50+83)/3≈77.6 → ~78. 

Alternatively, considering the missing analysis_3 is a completeness loss, and the accuracy loss from incorrect data references, perhaps the accuracy is 50, completeness 83. Total around 77. 

Hmm, I'll tentatively assign Analyses a score of 75. 

**Results Component:**

Ground truth has four results entries (analysis_ids 1,4,5,6). The predicted has three results entries: analysis_1,5,6. Missing analysis_4's result (the features from differential gene expression analysis). 

Check structure: All entries in predicted results are valid. Keys are correct. 

Accuracy: The existing entries (analysis_1,5,6) have their features matching GT? 

Looking at the features:

Analysis_1's features in both GT and predicted: same list (["KRA", ... SMAD4"]). Correct. 

Analysis_5: features match. 

Analysis_6: features match. 

The missing analysis_4 is the one with features like CPB1, etc. 

So accuracy for existing entries is 100. 

Completeness: 3/4 → 75. 

Structure: 100. 

Accuracy: 100 (all existing entries are correct). 

Completeness: 75 (missing one result). 

Total score: (100 + 100 +75)/3 ≈ 91.6 → 92. 

Wait, but the analysis_4's result is missing in predicted. So completeness is 3/4=75. So yes. 

Putting it all together:

Final Scores:

Data: ~92 (91.67)

Analyses: Let me recalculate:

Structure: 100.

Accuracy: For analyses, the problem is the missing analysis_3 and the references to it causing inaccuracies in analysis_1,4,6. 

If analysis_3 were present, then analysis_1 and analysis_4,6 would be correct. Since analysis_3 is missing, those entries have errors. 

Thus, the presence of analysis_3 is crucial. The predicted analyses have 5 entries but miss analysis_3. 

The accuracy of the analyses not counting the missing one: analysis_1 is incorrect (because data_3 is missing in data), analysis_4 and 6 have incorrect data references. Only analysis_2 and 5 are correct. 

Thus, of the 5 in predicted, 2 are accurate. So 40% accuracy. 

Completeness: 5/6 = ~83. 

So total: (100 + 40 + 83)/3 ≈ 74.3 → ~74. 

Alternatively, maybe the accuracy is 50 (if analysis_4 is partially correct?), but I think 40 is fair. 

Alternatively, maybe the missing analysis_3 is counted as an accuracy error as well? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the accuracy is calculated as (number of accurate analyses / total in GT). 

Accurate analyses in predicted: analysis_2 and 5. The other three (1,4,6) have errors, and analysis_3 is missing. So 2 out of 6 → ~33% accuracy. But that seems low. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe better to think of accuracy as how much the predicted matches the GT, considering semantic equivalence. 

The predicted is missing analysis_3 and its corresponding result. 

Also, in analyses, analysis_1's data is wrong (points to data_3 which is missing). Since data_3 is part of the GT, but the predicted didn't include it, the analysis_1 in predicted is incorrect. 

Analysis_4 in predicted references analysis_3 which is missing, so it's invalid. 

Analysis_6 also references analysis_3, making it invalid. 

So the only correct analyses are analysis_2 and 5. 

Thus, accuracy score for Analyses: (2/6)*100 = ~33.3%? But that might be too strict. 

Alternatively, if the analysis_4 and 6 are present but have incorrect data links, they are partially correct but not fully accurate. 

Maybe a middle ground: 

Structure: 100.

Accuracy: Let's say 50 (half the analyses have issues). 

Completeness: 83. 

Total: (100 + 50 +83)/3 = 77.66 → ~78. 

Hmm. Alternatively, the main issue is the missing data_3 leading to cascading errors. 

Perhaps the accuracy is 60. 

Overall, I'll assign Analyses a score of 75. 

So final scores:

Data: 92

Analyses: 75

Results: 92

Wait, but let me confirm Results again:

Results in predicted are missing analysis_4's features. So completeness is 3/4 (75). All existing entries are accurate. So yes, 92.

Alternatively, if the structure is perfect, accuracy 100, completeness 75 → (100+100+75)/3= 91.67 → 92.

Yes.

So final scores would be:

Data: 92

Analyses: Let me try again. Suppose the Analyses score:

Structure: 100.

Accuracy: 

- Of the analyses present (5):

Analysis_1: data_3 is missing in data, so invalid → 0.

Analysis_2: correct →100.

Analysis_4: references analysis_3 (missing) → 0.

Analysis_5: correct →100.

Analysis_6: references analysis_3 →0.

So total accurate analyses in predicted: 2 (analysis_2 and 5). 

Accuracy per analysis: (2/5)*100 = 40% accuracy for the analyses present. 

But since the accuracy aspect is compared to ground truth, perhaps it's (correct analyses / total in GT). 

Correct analyses: analysis_2,5 → 2/6 ≈ 33.3%.

But that's too low. Alternatively, maybe the analysis_4 and 6 are present but their data references are wrong, but the names and other parts are right. 

Analysis_4's name is correct, and its label is correct. The error is in the data references. So maybe 50% for that analysis (if half the info is correct). 

Same for analysis_1: name is correct, but data is wrong. So 50% each. 

Then:

Analysis_1: 50

Analysis_2:100

Analysis_4:50

Analysis_5:100

Analysis_6:50

Total: (50+100+50+100+50)/5 = 350/5=70. So accuracy is 70.

Thus, the accuracy score for Analyses would be 70.

Completeness: 5/6 ≈83.3%

Structure:100

Total: (100 +70 +83.3)/3 ≈ 84.4 → ~84.

Hmm, maybe that's better. 

Alternatively, the accuracy is 70, structure 100, completeness 83 → total 84. 

I think this is more reasonable. 

So final scores:

Data: 92

Analyses: 84

Results:92

Wait, but why did I think Analyses had 75 before? Maybe I need to recalculate with this method.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is:

For Analyses:

Structure is perfect (100).

Accuracy: 

The analysis entries that are present have some inaccuracies due to missing dependencies (data_3 and analysis_3). 

The analysis_1's data is wrong (referring to data_3 which isn't present). So that's an error. 

Analysis_4 and 6 refer to analysis_3 which is missing. 

But the analysis_3 itself is missing in predicted. 

So, the analysis_3's absence causes three other analyses to be incorrect (analysis_1,4,6). 

The analysis_3 is a phosphoproteomic analysis linked to data_2. Since data_2 exists, analysis_3 should have been present but wasn't. 

Thus, the missing analysis_3 is a completeness loss (1/6) and also causes the other analyses to have errors. 

This makes the accuracy lower. 

If we consider each analysis's correctness:

analysis_1: 0 (data_3 is missing in data)

analysis_2: 100

analysis_4: 0 (because analysis_3 is missing)

analysis_5: 100

analysis_6: 0 (analysis_3 missing)

Total correct: 2 out of 5 in predicted → 40% accuracy.

Completeness: 5/6 →83.3%.

So total: (100 +40 +83.3)/3 ≈ 74.4 → ~74.

Hmm, this is conflicting. Depending on how you weight the dependencies. 

Alternatively, maybe the dependencies are part of the analysis's content. So if the analysis_data is wrong, the whole analysis is wrong. 

In that case, the accuracy for the analyses would be (2/5)*100 =40. 

Therefore, the Analyses score would be (100 +40 +83)/3 = 74.3 → 74.

I think I need to make a decision here. Considering the missing analysis_3 and the resulting errors in other analyses, I'll go with 74 for Analyses.

Final scores:

Data: 92,

Analyses: 74,

Results: 92.

Wait but earlier I thought Results was 92. Let me confirm Results:

Results in Ground Truth has four entries. Predicted has three (missing analysis_4's features). All existing entries have correct features. 

Structure: perfect (JSON valid, correct keys).

Accuracy: 100% for existing entries (since features match exactly).

Completeness: 3/4 →75.

Thus, (100+100+75)/3 = 91.6 →92. 

So final scores would be:

Data:92, Analyses:74, Results:92.

Alternatively, maybe Analyses' completeness is 83.3 (5/6) and accuracy 50 (assuming some partial credits), leading to a higher score. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that even if dependencies are missing, the analysis entry itself is correct except for the data links, so the accuracy is higher. 

Alternatively, if the analysis_4 in predicted is present with the correct name and label, but wrong data references, perhaps it's 50% accurate for that analysis. Same for analysis_1 and 6. 

So:

Analysis_1: 50 (name correct, data wrong),

Analysis_4:50,

Analysis_6:50,

analysis_2:100,

analysis_5:100,

Total per analysis: (50+100+50+100+50)/5 = 350/5=70.

So accuracy is 70.

Completeness 83.3,

Structure 100,

Total: (100+70+83)/3= 84.3 →84.

I think this is more reasonable because the names and other parts are correct except the data references. 

So I'll go with Analyses:84.

Final Scores:

Data:92,

Analyses:84,

Results:92.

Wait, but in the Analyses component's analysis_1's data references data_3 which isn't present in the predicted data array. So that's an error not just in the analysis's data link but also because the data itself is missing. 

However, the accuracy aspect considers whether the predicted matches the ground truth. The ground truth's analysis_1 does have data_3, but in the predicted, data_3 is missing. So the analysis_1's analysis_data is incorrect because it's pointing to a non-existent data. Thus, the analysis_1 is incorrect. 

Therefore, the analysis_1 is entirely wrong. So maybe the accuracy is lower. 

Given the confusion, I'll settle on the following scores after careful consideration:

Data: 92 (structure 100, accuracy 100, completeness 75 → avg 91.67)

Analyses: 75 (structure 100, accuracy 60, completeness 83 → avg (100+60+83)= 243/3=81 → wait, maybe I miscalculated. If accuracy is 60, completeness 83.3, then 100+60+83.3=243.3/3≈81.1 → 81)

Hmm, perhaps the Analyses score is 81.

Alternatively, if accuracy is 50, then 100+50+83.3= 233.3/3≈77.7 → 78.

This is really tough without clear guidelines. To simplify, maybe:

Data: 92,

Analyses: 80 (average of structure 100, accuracy 70, completeness 83 → (100+70+83)/3=84.3 → rounded 84),

Wait, but I think I need to pick numbers that make sense. 

Alternatively, the assistant might give:

Final Scores:

Data: 92,

Analyses: 75,

Results:92,

But I need to ensure I'm applying the criteria properly. 

Another angle: For Analyses:

- Structure is perfect (100).

- Accuracy: The predicted analyses include analysis_1 which is incorrect (data_3 not present in data), analysis_4 and 6 which reference missing analysis_3. The names and other attributes are correct except the data references. Assuming that the analysis_data being wrong makes the entire analysis entry inaccurate, then out of 5 entries, only analysis_2 and 5 are accurate. So 2/5 →40% accuracy. 

Completeness: 5/6 →83.3.

Thus total (100+40+83)/3 = 223/3 ≈74.3 →74.

So I think 74 is fair. 

Final Scores:

Data:92,

Analyses:74,

Results:92.

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe the user expects higher scores. 

Alternatively, maybe the Analyses' accuracy is higher because some parts are correct. 

Well, proceeding with these scores.

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 92,
        "Analyses": 74,
        "Results": 92
    }
}

**Explanation:**

### **Data Component (Score: 92)**  
- **Structure**: Valid JSON format with correct key-value structures (100).  
- **Accuracy**: All existing entries (data_1, data_2, data_4) are semantically and factually accurate (100).  
- **Completeness**: Missing `data_3` (WES data) reduces coverage by 25% (75).  

### **Analyses Component (Score: 74)**  
- **Structure**: Valid JSON format with correct keys (100).  
- **Accuracy**:  
  - Missing `analysis_3` (Phosphoproteomic analysis) breaks dependencies for `analysis_1`, `analysis_4`, and `analysis_6`.  
  - `analysis_1`, `analysis_4`, and `analysis_6` have invalid references to missing `data_3` (in `analysis_1`) and `analysis_3` (in `analysis_4/6`).  
  - Only `analysis_2` (proteomic analysis) and `analysis_5` (Pathway enrichment) are fully accurate (2/6 total analyses → 33% accuracy). Partial deductions for other entries reduce accuracy to ~40%.  
- **Completeness**: Missing `analysis_3` reduces coverage by ~17% (83%).  

### **Results Component (Score: 92)**  
- **Structure**: Valid JSON format with correct keys (100).  
- **Accuracy**: All existing results (`analysis_1`, `analysis_5`, `analysis_6`) match ground truth (100).  
- **Completeness**: Missing `analysis_4`’s features reduces coverage by 25% (75).  

Scores reflect penalties for missing critical objects (`data_3`, `analysis_3`, and `analysis_4` results) and cascading inaccuracies caused by omissions.
