Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component: data, analyses, and results. Wait, the user mentioned three components, but looking at the input, there's no "results" part. Hmm, maybe it's a typo? The input has "data" and "analyses" in both groundtruth and annotation. Maybe "results" was intended but not present here. Since the problem mentions all three, but they aren't in the inputs, perhaps I should just focus on the two available parts, data and analyses. Or maybe "results" refers to another section not shown here. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user's input includes both groundtruth and annotation for "data" and "analyses". The task says the components are data, analyses, and results. But in the given examples, the JSON structures have only data and analyses. Maybe the results part is missing in the input provided, so perhaps I should proceed with what's given, assuming maybe the user made an error. Alternatively, maybe "results" are part of the analyses? Not sure, but since the user specified three components, but only two are present, perhaps I should consider only data and analyses, or maybe there's an oversight. Let me proceed with the data and analyses sections first, as those are present.

Starting with the "data" objects:

First, the structure score for data: 10 points. Need to check if the annotation's data follows the correct JSON structure. Groundtruth's data entries have keys like id, omics, source, link, format, public_id. The annotation's data entries also have the same keys except sometimes different values. So structure-wise, they look okay. Are there any missing keys? Let me see. In the groundtruth, all entries have those keys. In the annotation, same keys are present. So structure is correct. So full 10 points for structure.

Next, content completeness for data: 40 points. We need to check if all sub-objects (data entries) in the groundtruth are present in the annotation. The groundtruth has 10 data entries (data_1 to data_10). The annotation has 10 entries as well (data_1 to data_10). However, the content might differ. But we have to check if the sub-objects are present, considering semantic equivalence even if IDs differ. 

Wait, the IDs are different but the content is important. Let's compare each groundtruth data entry with the annotation's.

Groundtruth data_1:
omics: Bulk transcriptome
source: National Omics Data Encyclopedia
link: http://www.biosino.org/node
public_id: ["OEP003152", "OER330659"]

Annotation data_1:
omics: single-cell RNA sequencing
source: Mendeley Data Portal
link: different URL
public_id: r8U17IS

These are different. The omics type changed from Bulk to single-cell. So this is a different sub-object. So this would mean the groundtruth data_1 isn't present in the annotation. So that's a missing sub-object.

Groundtruth data_2:
omics: Metabolome, source same as above, etc. public_id same. 

Annotation data_2 has omics: Bulk transcriptome, source MetaboLights. Different from groundtruth data_2 (which is Metabolome). So not equivalent.

Continuing this way, most entries in the annotation do not match the groundtruth's data entries. Let's go through all:

Groundtruth data_3: Proteome, source National... public_ids OEP etc.
Annotation data_3 has Proteome, source same as National, public_ids same. So this one matches. 

Groundtruth data_4: omics single-cell RNA seq, source same, public_ids same.
Annotation data_1 and data_7,9 are single-cell RNA, but data_4 in groundtruth vs annotation's data_4 is Proteome. So no match here.

Groundtruth data_5: Bulk transcriptome, source TCGA, link cbioportal. Public_id empty.
Annotation data_5 is Genomics, source biosino NODE db. Not matching.

Groundtruth data_6: Bulk transcriptome, source empty, public_id GSE71729. 
In annotation, data_6 has omics RRBS, which doesn't match.

Groundtruth data_7: same as data_6, proteome? Wait, groundtruth data_7's omics is empty, link to TCPA. Annotation's data_7 has omics single-cell RNA. Not a match.

Groundtruth data_8: omics empty, link to TCPA. Annotation's data_8 is WES, different.

Groundtruth data_9: Spatial transcriptome. Annotation data_9 is single-cell RNA.

Groundtruth data_10: Spatial metabolome. Annotation data_10 is Genotyping data.

So, only groundtruth data_3 matches exactly with annotation data_3. The others don't match. So out of 10 sub-objects in groundtruth, only 1 is present. That's a big deduction. The content completeness is 40 points, so per sub-object, each missing one would lose points. Since there are 10 sub-objects, maybe each worth 4 points (since 40/10 =4). If 1 is present, then 9 missing, so 9*4=36 points lost, leaving 4? Wait, but maybe it's per sub-object presence. Wait the instruction says "deduct points for missing any sub-object." So for each missing sub-object in the annotation compared to groundtruth, minus some amount. The exact deduction per missing isn't specified, but likely proportional. Since there are 10 sub-objects in groundtruth, each worth 4 (40/10), so each missing sub-object would deduct 4. If only 1 is present, then 9 missing, so 9*4=36 deducted, so 4 points left. However, the annotation has 10 entries too, but they are extra ones not in groundtruth. The note says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." So adding extra sub-objects not in groundtruth could also be penalized. So total completeness score: 4 (for the 1 correct) minus penalty for 9 missing and 9 extra (since the annotation has 10, but only 1 matches, so 9 are extra). But how much is the penalty for extras?

The problem says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." So maybe for each extra, a small penalty? Let's assume for each extra, 1 point off. So 9 extra would deduct 9, so total: 4 -9= negative? That can't be. Maybe the maximum is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum deduction is 40, so if you have more than groundtruth, maybe the penalty is for both missing and excess. Alternatively, maybe the completeness is only about missing ones. Let me re-read the instructions:

"Content completeness accounts for 40 points: This section should score at the sub-object level. Deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches. Thoroughly analyze each groundtruth sub-object's semantic correspondence before determining annotation result equivalency. Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

So first, missing sub-objects: each missing one reduces the score. Then, extra ones also reduce. But the total possible is 40. Let's think: The groundtruth has N sub-objects. The annotation has M. The correctly matched ones are K. So the number of missing is (N-K), and the number of extra is (M-K). The penalty for missing is per missing, and penalty for extra is per extra. The total deductions would be (missing_penalty * (N-K)) + (extra_penalty * (M-K)). The initial score is 40, so subtract those. But how much per penalty?

The problem doesn't specify exact numbers, so perhaps a fair approach is: each missing sub-object (from groundtruth not found in annotation) deducts (40/N)*per missing. Here, N=10, so 4 points per missing. If K=1, then missing is 9, so 9*4=36. Then, the extra sub-objects: (M - K)= 9, so maybe each extra deducts (say) 1 point. So 9*1=9. Total deduction 45. But 40-45 would be negative. Instead, perhaps the maximum deduction is 40. So maybe the total deductions can't exceed 40. So total deduction is min(4*(missing) + 1*(extras), 40). 

Alternatively, maybe the penalty for extra is less. Let me think. Since the instructions say "may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance," so it's up to judgment. Since the user is doing this, perhaps the main issue is missing sub-objects, so let's focus on that first. 

Given that only 1 sub-object (data_3) matches, meaning 9 missing. So 9*4=36 deduction, so 4 points remaining. Then, the extra sub-objects (the other 9 in annotation that aren't in groundtruth) might be considered irrelevant, so perhaps each extra deducts 1 point (total 9), so total deduction becomes 36+9=45, but since max is 40, cap at 40. Hence, the completeness score would be 0. But that seems harsh. Alternatively, maybe the extra penalty is only half. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that if the annotation has more entries but they are incorrect, but since the user is supposed to check for equivalency, maybe the extra entries are penalized but not as much. Alternatively, perhaps the completeness is purely about missing, and the extra don't affect it. The instructions mention "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties", but it's ambiguous. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the main penalty is for missing, and the extra might add some, but let's proceed with the missing being the primary factor.

So with 9 missing, 4 points left. Thus, content completeness score for data is 4 out of 40.

Now, content accuracy (50 points). This applies only to the matched sub-objects. Only data_3 matches between groundtruth and annotation. Let's check its keys:

Groundtruth data_3:
omics: Proteome
source: National Omics Data Encyclopedia
link: http://www.biosino.org/node
public_id: ["OEP003152", "OER330659"]

Annotation data_3:
omics: Proteome
source: National Omics Data Encyclopedia (same)
link: same URL
public_id: same array.

All keys match exactly. So this sub-object is fully accurate. So for content accuracy, since only this one exists, 50 points for that. But since the total possible is 50, and only one sub-object, it gets full 50. However, the other sub-objects are missing, so their accuracy isn't considered. So total accuracy score is 50.

Thus, total data score: structure 10 + completeness 4 + accuracy 50 → 64? Wait wait, no. Wait, the total for each object (data, analyses, results) is 100. The structure is 10, content completeness 40, accuracy 50. So adding them: 10 +4 +50 =64. So the data score would be 64/100.

Wait, but let me confirm again. The structure is correct, so 10. Content completeness was 4 (out of 40). Accuracy was 50 (out of 50). So total is 10+4+50=64. Yes.

Now moving to Analyses.

First, structure score for analyses: check if the JSON structure is correct. Groundtruth's analyses have sub-objects with keys like id, analysis_name, analysis_data, training_set, test_set, label. The annotation's analyses also have similar keys. For example, in groundtruth analysis_1 has analysis_data as ["data_1"], while in annotation analysis_1 has analysis_data ["data_1"]. The structure looks okay. All required keys are present where needed? Let's see:

Groundtruth has entries with analysis_data, training_set, test_set, labels. The annotation has some entries with training_set and test_set as strings instead of arrays (e.g., analysis_4 has training_set: "zvnZ91-btfH"), but the structure is still valid as per JSON; maybe the type is wrong, but the keys exist. However, according to the problem statement, structure is about correct JSON structure and key-value pair structure, not the data types. So as long as the keys are present, structure is okay. So structure is 10.

Content completeness for analyses: 40 points. Groundtruth has 19 analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_21, skipping some IDs like analysis_6,9,15?). Let me count:

Groundtruth analyses list: analysis_1 to analysis_21, but checking the list:

Looking at the groundtruth's analyses array:

There are entries numbered analysis_1, 2, 3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. So total 19 analyses.

The annotation's analyses have entries from analysis_1 to analysis_21 but some missing and some added. Let me count the annotation's analyses:

The annotation's analyses array has entries:

analysis_1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 → that's 19 entries as well. So same number. But need to see if each corresponds to a groundtruth entry.

We need to check for each groundtruth analysis if there's a corresponding analysis in the annotation with semantically equivalent content.

This is complex because many analysis names differ. Let's go step by step.

Groundtruth analysis_1:
analysis_name: Transcriptomics, analysis_data: [data_1]

Annotation analysis_1:
analysis_name: Transcriptomics, analysis_data: [data_1]. Wait, in groundtruth data_1 is bulk transcriptome, but in annotation's data_1 is single-cell RNA. However, the analysis references data_1 regardless. The analysis's own name is same, so maybe considered equivalent. So this matches.

Groundtruth analysis_2:
analysis_name: Proteomics, analysis_data: [data_2] (data_2 is metabolome in groundtruth, but analysis name Proteomics? Wait original groundtruth analysis_2's analysis_data is data_2 which in groundtruth is Metabolome, but analysis name is Proteomics. That might be a mistake, but in any case, the annotation's analysis_2 is "Principal component analysis (PCA)", analysis_data: [data_14], which is not present in groundtruth data. So this doesn't match. 

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me try to find matches.

Going one by one:

Groundtruth analysis_1 matches with annotation's analysis_1 (same name and data reference, even if data's content differs, but the analysis's own properties are same).

Groundtruth analysis_2 (Proteomics on data_2) → in annotation, there's no analysis named Proteomics pointing to data_2 (since annotation's data_2 is different omics type). So this is missing.

Groundtruth analysis_3: Differential analysis on analysis_1 (transcriptomics) with label treated. Annotation has analysis_3: Differential analysis on analysis_1 (same name and structure?), so yes, this matches.

Groundtruth analysis_4: Survival analysis with training set analysis_3 and test sets data5-7. In annotation, analysis_4 has different details (training_set as string "zvn..." which is not a data ID). So doesn't match.

Groundtruth analysis_5: Functional Enrichment Analysis on analysis_3. Annotation's analysis_5 is Least Square regression, different name and data. Not a match.

Groundtruth analysis_7: Differential analysis on analysis_2 (proteomics). In annotation, analysis_7 is Differential analysis on analysis_2 (which in annotation is PCA analysis on data_14). Not the same.

Groundtruth analysis_8: Functional Enrichment on analysis_7. Annotation's analysis_8 is Single cell Clustering on analysis_1. Doesn't match.

Groundtruth analysis_10: Single cell Transcriptomics on data_4. Annotation's analysis_10 is Bray-Curtis NMDS on data_7. Doesn't match.

Groundtruth analysis_11: Single cell Clustering on analysis_10. Annotation's analysis_11 is PCoA on analysis_1. No.

Groundtruth analysis_12: Single cell TCR-seq on data_4. Not in annotation.

Groundtruth analysis_13: relative abundance of immune cells on analysis_1. Not in annotation.

Groundtruth analysis_14: Spatial transcriptome on data_9. Annotation's analysis_14 is Transcriptomics on data_14 (non-existent data). Not match.

Groundtruth analysis_15: Metabolomics on data_2. Annotation's analysis_15 is wKDA on data_15 (invalid data ref). Doesn't match.

Groundtruth analysis_16: Bray-Curtis NMDS on analysis_16? Wait groundtruth analysis_16 is Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on analysis_16? Wait original groundtruth analysis_16 is "Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)" with analysis_data from analysis_16? Wait no, looking back:

Groundtruth analysis_16: analysis_name: Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), analysis_data: ["analysis_16"]? Wait no, in groundtruth, analysis_16's analysis_data is ["analysis_16"]? Wait no, let me check:

Wait groundtruth's analysis_16 is:

{
"id": "analysis_16",
"analysis_name": "Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)",
"analysis_data": ["analysis_16"]
}

Wait that can't be right, it's referencing itself. Probably a mistake, but in any case, the annotation's analysis_16 is "Co-expression network" with analysis_data ["analysis_7"], so no match.

Groundtruth analysis_17: Bray-Curtis NMDS on analysis_16 (but that's conflicting). Annotation's analysis_10 is Bray-Curtis NMDS on data_7. Partial match in name but data differs.

Groundtruth analysis_18: PCA on analysis_15. Annotation's analysis_2 is PCA on data_14. Doesn't match.

Groundtruth analysis_19: ROC on analysis_15 with label. Annotation's analysis_20 is DE analysis on analysis_5 with label. No match.

Groundtruth analysis_20: ROC? Not sure, but in any case, many don't match.

Groundtruth analysis_21: Spatial metabolomics on data_10. Annotation's analysis_21 is Spatial metabolomics on data_10 (assuming data_10 in annotation is Genotyping, but the analysis name matches). Wait the analysis name is "Spatial metabolomics" in both? Groundtruth analysis_21's analysis_data is data_10 (Spatial metabolome in groundtruth, but in annotation data_10 is Genotyping). However, the analysis name is the same, and the data reference is present. Even if the data's content differs, the analysis itself is about spatial metabolomics, so maybe considered a match.

So analysis_21 in both might match.

Let me tally up matches:

Groundtruth analyses that have matches in annotation:

analysis_1: match

analysis_3: match (analysis_3 in both)

analysis_21: match (analysis_21 in both, same name, data_10 referenced, even if data differs)

Possibly others?

Analysis_7 in groundtruth is Differential analysis on analysis_2 (proteomics), but in annotation analysis_7 is Differential analysis on analysis_2 (which is PCA). Since the analysis name is same (Differential analysis), but the analysis_data references a different sub-object. However, since the analysis's own parameters (like label) may also matter. Groundtruth analysis_7 has label treated: ["NAC", "UR"], and the annotation's analysis_7 also has label treated: same. So maybe counts as a match in terms of name and label, even though the analysis_data refers to a different sub-object. But the analysis_data's target is a different sub-object (analysis_2 in groundtruth refers to Proteomics data, while in annotation's analysis_2 is PCA analysis on data_14, which is not part of groundtruth's data. So the analysis's dependencies are different. Thus, might not be a semantic match. It's tricky. The problem states to prioritize semantic equivalence over literal. If the analysis name is the same and the label is the same, but the data it's analyzing is different, does that count as a match? Probably not, because the data it's analyzing is a key part of the analysis. Hence, analysis_7 might not count.

Similarly, analysis_16 in groundtruth is PCoA on analysis_16 (self-reference?), while in annotation it's Co-expression network on analysis_7. Not a match.

analysis_12: not present in annotation.

analysis_8: not a match.

analysis_10 in groundtruth vs annotation: different.

So total matches: analysis_1, analysis_3, analysis_21. That's 3 out of 19. Wait, but analysis_21's data is data_10 in both. In groundtruth, data_10 is Spatial metabolome, while in annotation it's Genotyping data. So the analysis is about Spatial metabolomics, but the data it references is Genotyping. Does that make the analysis invalid? The analysis name is "Spatial metabolomics", which requires metabolomics data. If the data referenced is Genotyping, then the analysis is misapplied. Thus, this might not be a valid match. So maybe analysis_21 doesn't count either.

Then only analysis_1 and analysis_3. So 2 matches.

Wait analysis_3 in groundtruth is Differential analysis on analysis_1 (transcriptomics), with label treated. In the annotation's analysis_3, it's Differential analysis on analysis_1 (transcriptomics), same label. Even though the underlying data (analysis_1's data in groundtruth is data_1 (bulk transcriptome) vs in annotation's analysis_1 is data_1 (single-cell RNA)), but the analysis_3 itself's parameters (name, data reference, label) match. So this is a valid match. So analysis_3 is counted.

Analysis_21: maybe not. So total matches are 2 (analysis_1 and 3). Let me check again.

Are there any others? Let's see analysis_17 in groundtruth is Bray-Curtis NMDS on analysis_16. In annotation, analysis_10 is Bray-Curtis NMDS on data_7. The analysis name is same, but data reference is different. But if the analysis is about NMDS, even if the data is different, maybe considered a match? Not sure. The analysis's data input is critical, so probably not.

Analysis_14 in groundtruth is Spatial transcriptome analysis on data_9. In annotation, analysis_14 is Transcriptomics on data_14 (non-existent). Not a match.

Analysis_15 in groundtruth is Metabolomics on data_2 (metabolome), but in annotation's analysis_15 is Weighted key driver analysis on data_15 (non-existent data). Not a match.

Analysis_20: groundtruth's analysis_20 is ROC on analysis_15 with label. In annotation's analysis_20 is DE analysis on analysis_5 with label jgXeoN. Not same name.

So only 2 matches (analysis_1 and 3). Plus maybe analysis_21 if we count despite data mismatch. Let's tentatively say 2.

Thus, out of 19 groundtruth analyses, only 2 are present in the annotation with semantic equivalence. Each missing would deduct (40/19 ≈ 2.1 points). So missing 17: 17*2.1 ≈35.7, leaving ~4.3 points. But since the annotation has 19 entries but most are extra, those may also deduct. The content completeness score would thus be low.

But let's recalculate precisely. The content completeness is 40 points. Each missing sub-object (analysis) deducts 40/19 ≈ 2.1 points. Missing 17 (if only 2 matches): 17*2.1≈36, so 40-36≈4. Then, extra analyses: the annotation has 19, but only 2 correct, so 17 extras. Penalty per extra? Maybe 1 point each (total 17), so total deduction 36+17=53, but capped at 40. So score is 40 - min(53,40) = 0. But this might be too harsh. Alternatively, maybe only the missing are penalized, and extras are also penalized but less. Let's assume missing penalize more. Let me think the problem says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance". So if the extra analyses are completely unrelated, they might deduct points. Suppose for each extra, 0.5 points off. Then total deductions: missing (17*2.1)=35.7 plus extras (17*0.5)=8.5 → total 44.2. Deduct from 40: score is negative, so 0. So the content completeness score would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the scorer would consider that while most are missing, some partial credit for having some structure. But given the instructions, I'll proceed with the calculation as per missing and extras.

Assuming content completeness score is 0 (because deductions exceed 40), but that might be too strict. Alternatively, if only the missing are considered, then 40 - (number missing * (40/19)). With 17 missing: 40 - (17*(40/19)) ≈40 - 35.8≈4.2. So around 4 points.

Moving to content accuracy (50 points). This is only for the matched analyses. The two matches are analysis_1 and analysis_3.

Analysis_1 in groundtruth and annotation both have analysis_name: "Transcriptomics", analysis_data: data_1. Even though data_1's content differs, the key-value pairs for the analysis itself (name and data reference) are correct. So accuracy for analysis_1 is full (assuming the analysis's own fields are correct).

Analysis_3 in groundtruth and annotation: same name, same analysis_data (analysis_1), same label (treated: NAC and UR). So all key-value pairs match. Thus, both analyses are accurate. 

Each analysis contributes to the accuracy score. The total possible is 50. There are 2 matched analyses. Assuming each analysis's accuracy is weighted equally, but the total is 50. If there are K matched analyses, each contributes 50/K points. Here K=2, so each contributes 25. Since both are perfect, total accuracy is 50.

However, the problem states that content accuracy is evaluated based on discrepancies in key-value pairs for the matched sub-objects. Since both matched analyses are fully accurate, the accuracy score is 50.

Thus, analyses total score: structure 10 + completeness (approx 4) + accuracy 50 → 64.

Wait, but if completeness is 0, then 10+0+50=60.

Hmm, depends on how completeness was calculated. If completeness was 4, then 10+4+50=64. If 0, then 60. Let me clarify:

If the content completeness for analyses is calculated as follows: 

Total groundtruth analyses:19. Number matched (semantically) is 2. So missing is 17. Each missing deducts 40/19≈2.1 points. So 17*2.1≈35.7. Thus remaining 40-35.7≈4.3, rounded to 4. 

Extra analyses: 19-2=17, but penalty per extra is perhaps 0.5 each (as before). 17*0.5=8.5. Total deduction:35.7+8.5≈44.2, exceeding 40, so score is 0. 

Alternatively, the problem may not deduct for extras beyond the missing. The instructions say "deduct points for missing any sub-object. Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties". So the deduction is for both missing and extra. So total deduction is missing_penalty + extra_penalty.

If each missing is 40/19 per, and each extra is (40/19)*(some fraction). Let's assume the penalty for each extra is half of missing. So per missing: 40/19 ≈2.1, per extra:1.05.

Total deductions: 17*(2.1 +1.05) ? No, maybe separate.

Missing deduction:17 * (40/19) ≈35.7

Extra deduction:17*(40/(19+17))? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe extras are penalized similarly. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's safer to assume that only missing are penalized for completeness, and extras are an additional penalty. Thus, if missing deduct 35.7, and extras deduct another 17*(something). But without clear instructions, perhaps the scorer would just focus on missing, giving 4.3. 

Assuming the scorer gives 4 points for completeness, then total analyses score is 10+4+50=64.

Thus, the final scores would be:

Data: 64

Analyses:64

Results: Since there's no results in the input, but the task mentions it, perhaps it's a mistake. The user might have intended only data and analyses. So maybe Results score is 0, but the problem says to score three components. Alternatively, maybe the user forgot to include it, but since it's not present, perhaps the scorer should state that Results couldn't be scored due to missing data. But the instructions say to output the three scores. Since the provided inputs don't have a "results" section, perhaps the scorer should assign 0 for results, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe "results" is part of analyses or data, but the user's input doesn't show it. Since the problem is from the user, perhaps they made an error, but I must follow the given inputs. Since there's no results in either groundtruth or annotation, I'll assume the results score is 0 or N/A, but the problem requires three scores. To comply, I'll set Results as 0.

Final Scores: 

"Data":64,

"Analyses":64,

"Results":0

But maybe the user considers that results are part of analyses. Alternatively, perhaps the results are present elsewhere. Looking back, the groundtruth has "results" as a component? No, in the given input, the JSON has only data and analyses. So perhaps Results isn't applicable here. Since the user's task mentions three components, but the inputs only have two, I'll proceed with the two and leave Results as 0 or note. But to adhere strictly to the task's requirement to output three scores, I'll set Results to 0.

However, maybe I missed something. Let me check again:

The problem says the three components are data, analyses, and results. The inputs (groundtruth and annotation) have data and analyses, but no results. Perhaps results are part of the analyses section? Not sure. Without information, I'll proceed as instructed.
