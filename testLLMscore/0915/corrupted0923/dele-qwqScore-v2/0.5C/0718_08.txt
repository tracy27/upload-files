Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

First, for the **Data** section:

The groundtruth has five data entries (data_1 to data_5), while the annotation has two (data_3 and data_4). Let's check each one.

Looking at data_1 in groundtruth: it's about Metabolomics from MetaboLights with public_id MTBLS7337. But the annotation doesn't include this. That's a missing sub-object, so content completeness will be hit here.

Similarly, data_2 (Proteomics from ProteomeXchange) isn't present in the annotation either. Another deduction.

data_3 and data_4 in the groundtruth are present in the annotation, so those are okay. However, data_5 (Metabolomics linked to mmc3.xlsx) is missing from the annotation. So three missing sub-objects out of five. 

For structure: All data entries in the annotation have the correct keys (id, omics, source, link, format, public_id). Even though some fields are empty, the structure is there. So full 10 points.

Content completeness: Each missing data entry (data_1, data_2, data_5) would deduct 40*(3/5)=24 points? Wait, no. Since each sub-object is a point? Wait, the instructions say deduct for missing any sub-object. Each missing sub-object in groundtruth that's not in the annotation gets a deduction. There are 5 in groundtruth, 2 in annotation. So 3 missing. Since the max is 40, perhaps each missing sub-object is worth (40/5)*each? Hmm, maybe better to consider each sub-object contributes equally. If there are 5, each is worth 40/5=8 points. Missing 3 would lose 24, so 16 left. But wait, the user says "deduct points for missing any sub-object". Maybe each missing sub-object deducts (total points)/number_of_groundtruth_sub_objects * number_missing? Alternatively, each missing is a flat deduction. The instructions aren't clear, but since "content completeness accounts for 40 points... deduct for missing any sub-object", probably per missing sub-object. Let me think again: if the groundtruth has N sub-objects, each missing one subtracts (40/N). Here N=5, so each missing is 8 points. So 3 missing gives 3*8=24 points off, so 40-24=16. 

But maybe the total possible points for completeness is 40, so each missing is 40*(missing_count/total_groundtruth_subobjs). Yes, that makes sense. So 3 missing: 3/5 = 0.6, so 40*(1 - 0.6)=16? Or 40*(1 - (3/5))? Either way, 16/40.

Now, content accuracy: The existing data_3 and data_4 in the annotation match exactly with the groundtruth. So 50 points. Since the missing ones aren't considered here, only the existing ones. Wait, accuracy is for the matched sub-objects. Since the two existing in the annotation match perfectly, then 50 points. 

Total Data Score: Structure 10 + completeness 16 + accuracy 50 = 76. Wait, but let me recheck:

Wait, the accuracy part: for each matched sub-object, all their key-value pairs are correct. For data_3 and data_4, yes, everything matches except maybe public_id and source? Wait, looking at data_4 in groundtruth: public_id is empty, and source is empty. The annotation's data_4 has same values. So yes, accurate. So accuracy is full 50. 

So Data: 10+16+50=76? Wait, but content completeness was 40*(number present / total groundtruth). Wait, maybe my calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate:

Content completeness: The groundtruth has 5 data sub-objects. The annotation has 2. So the number of missing is 3. The formula could be: (number present / total) * 40. So 2/5=0.4, so 0.4*40=16. So yes, that's right. So total 16 for completeness. 

Thus Data total is 10+16+50=76. Wait but 16+50 is 66 plus 10 is 76. Okay.

Next, **Analyses**:

Groundtruth has seven analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_7). Annotation has three (analysis_2, analysis_3, analysis_7). Let's check each.

Analysis_1 (Metabolomics, data_1) is missing. Analysis_4 (Differential with labels) and analysis_5 (another differential), analysis_6 (Functional Enrichment) are all missing. So four missing analyses. 

Structure: The analyses in the annotation have correct keys. For example, analysis_2 has analysis_name and analysis_data. The analysis_3 includes analysis_data as an array, which matches the groundtruth (though in groundtruth analysis_3 has an id typo with space?), but the structure is correct. Analysis_7 has training_set and label correctly. So structure is okay. So 10 points.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 7 analyses. Annotation has 3. So missing 4. So (3/7)*40 ≈ 17.14. But since we deduct per missing, each missing analysis is (40/7)≈5.71 points. Four missing: 4*(5.71) ≈22.86, so 40-22.86≈17.14. Rounded to 17.

Accuracy: The existing analyses in the annotation: analysis_2: in groundtruth, analysis_2's analysis_data is data_2, which exists in the groundtruth. But in the annotation, does data_2 exist? Wait, in the data section, the annotation didn't include data_2 (from groundtruth's data_2). Wait the analysis_2's analysis_data refers to data_2, but data_2 is missing in the annotation's data. Does that matter? Wait the analyses refer to data sub-objects. Since the data sub-object data_2 isn't present in the annotation's data, but the analysis is referencing it, that might be an issue. However, according to the problem statement, when evaluating analyses, do we check if the referenced data exists in the annotation? Or just that the analysis structure is correct?

Hmm, the instructions for content accuracy say "for sub-objects deemed semantically matched in the 'Content Completeness' section, deductions are applied based on discrepancies in key-value pair semantics". So if the analysis's analysis_data references data_2, but data_2 isn't present in the annotation's data, then that's a problem. Because in the groundtruth, analysis_2's data is data_2, but in the annotation's data, data_2 is missing. So the analysis_2 in the annotation's analyses is pointing to data_2 which is not present. Thus, this is an error in the key-value pair (analysis_data: "data_2"), because in the annotation's context, data_2 doesn't exist. So this would affect the accuracy.

Wait but the problem states that the user needs to score the annotations based on the groundtruth. So maybe the analysis's data references should correspond to the groundtruth's data? Or to the annotation's own data? 

This is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the instructions again. It says: "For sub-objects deemed semantically matched in the 'Content Completeness' section, deductions are applied based on discrepancies in key-value pair semantics." So the sub-object (analysis) must be semantically equivalent. If the analysis_data in the annotation's analysis_2 refers to data_2 which is present in the groundtruth but not in the annotation's data, then the analysis is incorrectly linking to a non-existent data in the annotation. Thus, this would be an inaccuracy.

Therefore, analysis_2's analysis_data ("data_2") is incorrect because data_2 is missing in the data section of the annotation. Hence, this key-value pair is wrong. 

Similarly, analysis_3 in the annotation has analysis_data as ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"]. But in the annotation's data, data_3 exists, but analysis_1 is missing (since analysis_1 is not present in the annotation's analyses). So analysis_1 is missing, so the analysis_data here includes a reference to analysis_1 which isn't present in the annotation's analyses. So another inaccuracy.

Analysis_7 in the annotation has training_set and label, which matches the groundtruth's analysis_7 except that in the groundtruth, analysis_7's training_set is ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"], but in the annotation, analysis_7's training_set is the same, but again analysis_1 and analysis_2 are missing in the annotation. So the references to analysis_1 and 2 are invalid in the annotation's context.

Wait, but maybe the analysis's analysis_data should refer to the data in the groundtruth, not the annotation's own data? The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but according to the task description, the annotation's own data and analyses are being evaluated against the groundtruth. So if the analysis's analysis_data references a data_id that's present in the groundtruth but not in the annotation's data, that's a problem because the annotation's data lacks that data. So the analysis is referring to a non-existent data in its own data section. Hence, that's an inaccuracy.

Alternatively, maybe the analysis_data can reference any data_id from the groundtruth, even if it's missing in the annotation. But that seems unlikely. The analysis should be consistent within its own data. 

Given that, let's proceed with the assumption that the analysis's data references must point to existing data in the annotation's data. 

So, analysis_2's analysis_data: "data_2" → data_2 is not in the annotation's data → inaccuracy.

analysis_3's analysis_data includes "analysis_1" which isn't present in the annotation's analyses → inaccuracy.

analysis_7's training_set includes "analysis_1" and "analysis_2", both missing → inaccuracies.

Additionally, analysis_3's id has a space before the number (" analysis_3" vs "analysis_3" in groundtruth), but the problem says to ignore IDs as long as content is same. So that's fine.

Now, calculating accuracy for the analyses present:

Let's list the analyses in the annotation:

analysis_2: 

In groundtruth analysis_2 has analysis_data: data_2 (which exists in groundtruth but not in annotation's data). So in the annotation, analysis_2's analysis_data is data_2, which is invalid in the annotation's data. So this key-value is wrong → loss.

analysis_3:

In groundtruth, analysis_3 has analysis_data as ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"]. In the annotation's analysis_3, analysis_data is ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"]. But analysis_1 and analysis_2 don't exist in the annotation's analyses/data. So the references are invalid. Thus, this key-value is incorrect.

analysis_7:

In groundtruth, analysis_7's training_set is ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"], which in the annotation's version is the same. However, analysis_1 and analysis_2 are missing, so references are invalid. Additionally, the rest of the fields (label) match. But since the training_set references invalid IDs, this is a problem.

Wait, but maybe the label is correct. The label in analysis_7 matches exactly. So part of the key-value pairs are correct, others are wrong.

Calculating accuracy points:

Each analysis has key-value pairs. For analysis_2: the analysis_name is correct ("Proteomics"), but analysis_data is wrong (points to non-existent data). So partial accuracy?

Hmm, the accuracy is for the entire key-value pairs of the matched sub-object. Since the analysis_2's analysis_data is incorrect, that's a discrepancy. Similarly for the other analyses.

So for analysis_2:

- analysis_name: "Proteomics" matches → correct.
- analysis_data: "data_2" → incorrect (because data_2 is missing in data).

Since one of two key-value pairs (assuming analysis_data and analysis_name are the main ones) is wrong, maybe half accuracy here. But the problem says to prioritize semantic equivalence. Maybe the analysis_data is a critical field, so this would count as a major inaccuracy.

Alternatively, each key is considered. The keys for analysis are id, analysis_name, analysis_data, training_set (if applicable), label, etc. 

Let me look at the groundtruth analysis_2's keys: {"id": "analysis_2", "analysis_name": "Proteomics", "analysis_data": "data_2"}

The annotation's analysis_2 has same keys. The analysis_name is correct, analysis_data is wrong. So two key-value pairs: analysis_name is correct, analysis_data is wrong. So 50% accuracy for this sub-object. But since there are multiple sub-objects (the analyses), each analysis's accuracy contributes to the total.

The total accuracy is over all the matched analyses (those present in both groundtruth and annotation). Wait, but accuracy is for the matched sub-objects. The analyses that are present in both must first be considered as matched. 

Wait, first, in content completeness, we determined which sub-objects are present. For the analyses, the ones present in the annotation are analysis_2, analysis_3 (with space?), analysis_7. 

Wait, analysis_3 in the groundtruth is " analysis_3" (with leading space?), but in the annotation it's " analysis_3" as well? Let me check:

Groundtruth's analysis_3 has "id": " analysis_3" (with a space after the colon?), or maybe a typo in the input. Looking back:

In groundtruth's analyses: { "id": " analysis_3", ... }, whereas the annotation's analysis_3 also has " analysis_3" (assuming same typo). Since the id's content is the same (including the space?), but the problem says to ignore IDs as long as content is same. Wait, the IDs themselves are part of the structure. Wait, the structure score is about the JSON structure and key-value pairs, so the presence of a space in the id's value is part of the structure. But the problem says: "data_id or analysis_id are only unique identifiers for sub-objects. When the same sub-objects are ordered differently, their IDs may vary. Therefore, scoring should focus on the sub-objects content, rather than using IDs to assess consistency, Do not deduct to different ID with same semantical content."

Ah, so the ID's value itself (e.g., "analysis_3" vs " analysis_3") is irrelevant as long as the content (the actual data) is the same. Wait, but in this case, the analysis_3 in groundtruth has an id with a leading space: " analysis_3", whereas the annotation's analysis_3 has the same? Let me confirm:

In the groundtruth's analyses array:

{
    "id": " analysis_3",
    "analysis_name": "Principal component analysis (PCA)",
    "analysis_data": ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"]
},

Yes, the id has a leading space. In the annotation's analysis_3:

{
  "id": " analysis_3",
  ...
}

Same as groundtruth. So the content is same, so the ID difference (due to spacing) doesn't matter. So that's okay.

So the analyses present in the annotation are analysis_2, analysis_3, analysis_7. 

Comparing each to their groundtruth counterparts:

Analysis_2:

Groundtruth analysis_2: analysis_data is "data_2".

Annotation analysis_2: analysis_data is "data_2". But in the annotation's data, data_2 doesn't exist. So this is a discrepancy. The analysis_data should refer to a data that exists in the annotation's data. Since it doesn't, this is an error. The key-value pair here is incorrect. So this analysis's accuracy is partially lost.

Analysis_3:

Groundtruth analysis_3 has analysis_data as ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"].

Annotation analysis_3 has same analysis_data. But analysis_1 is missing in the annotation's analyses, so the reference to analysis_1 is invalid. So this key-value pair is incorrect. 

Analysis_7:

Groundtruth analysis_7 has training_set ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"], and label is correct. The annotation's analysis_7 has the same training_set (invalid references) but label is correct. So the training_set is incorrect due to missing analyses/data, but label is correct.

So for each analysis in the annotation, we need to see how many of their key-value pairs are accurate.

Assuming each analysis has multiple key-value pairs contributing to accuracy:

Take analysis_2:

Keys: id (irrelevant), analysis_name (correct), analysis_data (incorrect). So two keys: one correct, one wrong. So 50% accuracy for this analysis.

Analysis_3:

Keys: analysis_name (correct: PCA), analysis_data (incorrect due to references to missing analyses/data). So again, maybe 50%.

Analysis_7:

Keys: analysis_name (correct), training_set (incorrect due to analysis_1 and 2 missing), label (correct). So two correct, one incorrect (training_set). Assuming three keys (name, training_set, label), 2/3 correct → ~66% accuracy.

Total accuracy for these three analyses: 

Each analysis's accuracy contributes to the total. Let's assign points per analysis:

Each analysis has an accuracy score (out of 50 total points for accuracy). Wait no, the total accuracy is 50 points for the entire analyses section. The key-value pairs across all matched sub-objects are considered.

Alternatively, the 50 points are divided among the sub-objects. Since there are 3 present analyses, each contributes up to (50/7)*3? Wait, no, perhaps the total accuracy is calculated as follows:

Total possible accuracy points: 50. 

Each matched sub-object (analysis) has its key-value pairs evaluated. The total deductions are based on discrepancies. 

Alternatively, for each key-value pair in the matched analyses, if it's correct, full points; if incorrect, deduct proportionally.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest approach is:

For each of the 3 analyses present in the annotation, check their key-value pairs compared to the groundtruth's corresponding analyses (even if the groundtruth's analysis has more keys).

Analysis_2:

- analysis_name: correct → good.
- analysis_data: references data_2 which is present in groundtruth but not in the annotation's data → discrepancy. So this key is wrong. 

Thus, two key-value pairs (name and data), one correct, one wrong. So 50% accuracy for this analysis.

Analysis_3:

- analysis_name: correct (PCA)
- analysis_data: includes analysis_1 (missing in annotation's analyses), so discrepancy. So key is wrong.
→ 50% accuracy.

Analysis_7:

- analysis_name: correct.
- training_set: references analysis_1 and 2 (missing in annotation's analyses) → discrepancy.
- label: correct.
Assuming three keys here (name, training_set, label), two correct → ~66.6% accuracy.

So total accuracy contribution from these three analyses:

Total key-value pairs across all three analyses:

Analysis_2: 2 keys → 1 correct.

Analysis_3: 2 keys → 1 correct.

Analysis_7: 3 keys → 2 correct.

Total correct: 1+1+2=4 out of total (2+2+3)=7 key-pairs. 

Thus, accuracy score would be (4/7)*50 ≈ 28.57 points. 

But maybe each analysis's key-value pairs are weighted equally regardless of the number of keys. Alternatively, each analysis's accuracy is computed individually, then averaged. 

Alternatively, since the problem states that for content accuracy, deductions are based on discrepancies in the key-value pairs of the matched sub-objects. Each discrepancy reduces the score. 

If each analysis's key-value pair discrepancy reduces the total accuracy points proportionally.

Suppose each analysis's accuracy is calculated as (number of correct key-value pairs / total key-value pairs in that analysis's groundtruth) * weight (based on number of sub-objects). 

Alternatively, this is getting too complex. Maybe a simpler approach: 

Total accuracy is 50 points. The three analyses are present, but each has inaccuracies. 

Analysis_2's analysis_data is wrong: deduct some points. 

Analysis_3's analysis_data is wrong: deduct.

Analysis_7's training_set is wrong: deduct.

Suppose each of these errors deducts 10 points each (total 30 deducted), leaving 20. 

Alternatively, each analysis has an impact. 

Alternatively, since the key-value pairs in analysis_data are critical, each such error deducts significantly. 

Perhaps the accuracy score for analyses would be around 20-30 points. 

This is a bit ambiguous without exact rubric, but I'll proceed with an approximate calculation. 

Assuming:

- Analysis_2: loses 20 points (half of its possible contribution)
- Analysis_3: another 20
- Analysis_7: 10
Total accuracy: 50 - (20+20+10) = 0? No, that can't be. 

Alternatively, each analysis's key-value discrepancies reduce the accuracy. Let's think of each sub-object's key-value pairs:

For analysis_2:

Groundtruth has analysis_data: data_2 (exists in groundtruth data), but in annotation's data, data_2 is missing. Thus, the analysis_data in the analysis is pointing to a non-existent data. This is a major error, so maybe this analysis contributes 0 towards accuracy.

Analysis_3:

The analysis_data includes analysis_1 which is missing, so similarly, this analysis's analysis_data is incorrect → 0.

Analysis_7's training_set references analysis_1 and 2 which are missing → incorrect. So training_set is wrong. But label is correct. 

So analysis_7 has one correct key (label) out of two keys (training_set and label). So maybe 25% accuracy for this analysis.

Thus, total accuracy contributions:

Analysis_2: 0 (since analysis_data is critical and wrong)

Analysis_3: 0

Analysis_7: 25% of its possible contribution. 

Assuming each analysis has equal weight (since there were 7 in groundtruth, but only 3 present), the total accuracy would be (0 + 0 + 25%) * (3/7 of total 50?) Not sure. 

Alternatively, the total accuracy is 50 points. The three analyses together have inaccuracies. Let's assume each of the three analyses has a portion of the 50. 

Each analysis's contribution to accuracy: 

Analysis_2: 0 points (since it's pointing to a missing data)

Analysis_3: 0

Analysis_7: maybe 10 points (since label is correct but training_set is wrong)

Total: 10. 

Thus accuracy would be 10, making the analyses total: 10 (structure) + 17 (completeness) + 10 = 37. But this might be too harsh. 

Alternatively, maybe the analysis_data references are allowed to point to groundtruth's data even if missing in the annotation's data. The problem states to evaluate based on the groundtruth's data. Wait no, the annotation is supposed to be self-contained. 

Alternatively, the analysis's analysis_data is correct if it matches the groundtruth's analysis_data, regardless of whether the data exists in the annotation's data. 

Wait, if that's the case, then analysis_2's analysis_data is correct (it points to data_2, which in the groundtruth exists). Even though the data_2 is missing in the annotation's data, the analysis's analysis_data is correct according to the groundtruth. 

Ah! This is a crucial point. The instructions say to use the groundtruth as reference. So when checking the annotation's analysis_data, it's correct if it matches what's in the groundtruth, even if the data isn't present in the annotation's data. Because the groundtruth's analysis references data_2, which exists in its data. So the annotation's analysis_2 having analysis_data=data_2 is correct according to the groundtruth. The fact that the data_2 is missing in the annotation's data is a content completeness issue in the data section, not the analysis's accuracy. 

Oh! This changes things. Because the analysis's analysis_data should match the groundtruth's analysis's analysis_data. So if the groundtruth analysis_2 has analysis_data=data_2, then the annotation's analysis_2 having analysis_data=data_2 is correct. Even though the data_2 isn't present in the annotation's data, that's a separate issue (data completeness), but the analysis's own key-value is correct. 

Ah! So the key-value pairs in the analysis's sub-object are judged based on matching the groundtruth's corresponding sub-object, not whether the referenced data exists in the annotation. 

That makes more sense. So for accuracy, the analysis's analysis_data is correct if it's the same as groundtruth's. The existence of the data is a data completeness issue. 

Therefore, redoing the analysis:

For accuracy in analyses:

Analysis_2:

analysis_data is correct (matches groundtruth's data_2). analysis_name matches. So all key-value pairs correct. Full points for this sub-object.

Analysis_3:

analysis_data in groundtruth is ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"]. The annotation's analysis_3 has the same analysis_data. So it's correct. Thus, this is fully accurate.

Analysis_7:

training_set in groundtruth is ["analysis_1", "analysis_2", "data_3"], which matches the annotation's training_set. The label is also correct. So this analysis is fully accurate. 

Thus, all three analyses in the annotation have accurate key-value pairs. So content accuracy is full 50 points.

But wait, analysis_3's id had a space, but as per instructions, IDs are ignored for content. So yes, accurate. 

Then, content completeness was 17 (since 3/7 analyses present). 

Structure: 10 points. 

Total Analyses score: 10 + 17 +50 = 77. 

Wait, that's better. Because earlier confusion was about whether the analysis_data needed the data to exist in the annotation. Now, realizing that it's just about matching the groundtruth's key-values, the accuracy is full. 

Proceeding with that:

Analyses:

Structure: 10.

Completeness: 3 out of 7 analyses → 3/7 *40 ≈17.14 → ~17.

Accuracy: 50 (all present analyses have correct key-values).

Total: 10+17+50=77.

Now, **Results** section.

Groundtruth has six results entries (analysis_ids 4 and 7 with various metrics). The annotation has three results (analysis_4 and analysis_7 with AUC, accuracy, recall).

First, check each result in groundtruth:

Groundtruth results:

- analysis_4 with features [four items]
- analysis_7 with metrics AUC, accuracy, recall, F1, precision (five entries).

The annotation has three results: analysis_4's features, analysis_7's AUC, accuracy, and recall. So missing analysis_7's F1 and precision, and the analysis_7's other entries (like F1 and precision). Also, the groundtruth's analysis_7 has five results entries (AUC, acc, recall, F1, precision). The annotation has three (AUC, acc, recall). So two missing.

Additionally, the groundtruth has analysis_4's features, which is present in the annotation. 

So total groundtruth results entries: 1 (analysis_4) +5 (analysis_7's) =6. Annotation has 1+3=4. So missing 2. 

Content completeness: (4/6)*40 ≈26.67.

Structure: All result entries have the required keys (analysis_id, metrics, value, features). The features in the groundtruth sometimes have nested lists (like in AUC for analysis_7). The annotation matches that structure. So structure is correct. 10 points.

Content accuracy: The existing entries must have correct key-values.

Check each:

analysis_4's features in both match exactly: four items. Correct.

analysis_7's AUC: metrics name correct, value matches [0.83,0.86,0.80,0.78,0.96]. In groundtruth, the value is the same. Features also match (the list including the sublist). 

Accuracy: metrics and value match (0.75,0.83). Features match.

Recall: same, values 0.4,1.00 (groundtruth has 0.40,1.00 → same). 

So the three entries in the annotation for analysis_7 are accurate. The missing F1 and precision are part of completeness, not accuracy. 

Thus, accuracy is full 50 points.

Total Results score: 10 +26.67 +50 ≈86.67 → rounded to 87.

Wait, let me confirm:

Completeness deduction: missing 2 out of 6 → (4/6)*40=26.666… so 26.67. 

So total Results: 10 +26.67 +50 = 86.67, which rounds to 87. 

But maybe the system expects integer scores. Perhaps truncate to whole numbers. So 86 or 87. Let's say 87.

Putting it all together:

Data: 76

Analyses:77

Results:87

Final Scores:

"Data": 76,

"Analyses":77,

"Results":87

But let me cross-verify all steps once more to ensure no miscalculations.

Data:

- Structure:10

- Completeness: 2/5 present → 2/5 *40=16.

- Accuracy: 50 (existing two are correct).

Total 76.

Analyses:

- Structure:10

- Completeness:3/7 → ~17.14

- Accuracy:50 (all three analyses have correct keys)

Total:77.14→77.

Results:

- Structure:10

- Completeness:4/6 → ~26.67

- Accuracy:50

Total:86.67→87.

Yes. So the final scores would be:

"Data":76,

"Analyses":77,

"Results":87.

Wait but the problem says to put the scores into the Final Scores object with integers. So rounding appropriately.

Hence, the final answer should be as specified.
</think>

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 76,
    "Analyses": 77,
    "Results": 87
}
