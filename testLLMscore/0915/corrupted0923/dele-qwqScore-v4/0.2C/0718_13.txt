Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component:**

First, check the structure. The predicted data is a list of objects with keys like id, omics, link, etc. They seem to follow the same structure as the ground truth. All entries have the required fields. So structure looks good. But wait, let me double-check each entry.

Looking at the ground truth, there are 8 data entries. The predicted has 4. Let's see which ones are missing. Ground truth has data_1, data_2 (RNA-seq), data_3 (RRBS), data_4 (proteomics), data_5 (phospho-proteomics), data_6,7,8 (transcriptomic). 

In predicted, they have data_1 (correct), data_4 (proteomics), data_6 (TCGA), data_8 (LIMORE). Missing are data_2 (RNA-seq), data_3 (RRBS), data_5 (phospho-proteomics), and data_7 (CPTAC). That's four missing entries. 

For completeness, since they missed 4 out of 8, that's half. So completeness would be penalized heavily here. 

Accuracy-wise, the existing entries match exactly except maybe for data_4? Wait, data_4 in ground truth is proteomics, which is present in the prediction. So the existing entries are accurate. But missing entries reduce completeness. 

So for Data:

Structure: 100% because all entries are correctly formatted. 

Completeness: 4 out of 8 correct entries. But wait, perhaps some missing ones are duplicates? Let me check again. 

Wait, data_2 is RNA-seq, data_3 RRBS (methylation?), data_5 phospho-proteomics. These are all distinct. So missing those would be bad. So completeness is 50%. But maybe the predicted has data_8 instead of data_7. Data_7 is from CPTAC, but data_8 is LIMORE. The ground truth data_8 has source LIMORE and public_id empty. The prediction's data_8 matches that. But data_7 is also present in ground truth. Since they omitted data_7 and included data_8, maybe data_8 is correct, but missing others. 

Therefore, completeness: 4/8 = 50%, so maybe 50 points for completeness. But also, did the prediction add any extra? No, they just have fewer. 

Accuracy is 100% for the existing entries. So total score would be structure 100, accuracy 100, completeness 50. But maybe the scoring criteria combines these aspects into a single score. Wait, the user says each component gets a score based on structure, accuracy, completeness. 

Wait, the scoring criteria says each component has a separate score (0-100) based on the three aspects. So I need to consider each aspect's contribution to the component's score. 

Hmm, perhaps each aspect contributes equally? Or maybe structure is binary (valid vs invalid). Since the structure is correct, that's full marks. 

Then accuracy is about factual correctness, so existing entries are accurate. 

Completeness is about coverage. Since they have 4/8, maybe 50% there. 

But maybe the weights aren't specified. The problem says to assign a score considering structure, accuracy, completeness. Maybe structure is pass/fail. If structure is okay (which it is), then the other two factors contribute. 

Alternatively, structure might be part of the total, so if structure is perfect, then the rest is based on accuracy and completeness. 

Assuming structure is full marks, then the Data component's score would be based on accuracy and completeness. 

Accuracy: all existing entries are accurate, so 100% on accuracy. 

Completeness: 4 out of 8 correct entries. But wait, maybe some entries in the ground truth are duplicates? Let me check:

Looking at the ground truth Data:

- data_1: WES

- data_2: RNA-seq

- data_3: RRBS (methylation)

- data_4: proteomics

- data_5: phospho-proteomics

- data_6: TCGA transcriptomic

- data_7: CPTAC transcriptomic

- data_8: LIMORE transcriptomic

Each is a different omics type or source. So all are distinct. So missing 4 entries. 

Thus, completeness is (4/8)*100 = 50. 

If both accuracy and completeness are weighted equally, maybe each is 50% of the remaining score after structure. 

Structure is 100 (assuming structure counts as part of the score, but maybe the total is 100, so structure is 1/3, accuracy 1/3, completeness 1/3? Wait the problem says "each component is scored based on three aspects". It doesn't specify weighting. Hmm tricky. 

The problem says "assign a separate score (0-100) for each of the three components. The score for each component is based on three evaluation aspects...". 

Probably, the aspects are considered together. Maybe the score is calculated by considering all three aspects holistically. 

Alternatively, perhaps each aspect is scored individually and then averaged. For example, structure could be 100 (since valid JSON), accuracy is 100 (existing entries are accurate), completeness is 50 (missing half). So average of 100,100,50 would be 83.3. 

But maybe the aspects have different weights. Since structure is about validity, perhaps it's a must-have (so if invalid, score drops), but here it's valid. Then the main issues are accuracy and completeness. 

Alternatively, the user might want each aspect to contribute equally, so each has maximum 100, but the component's overall score is the average. 

Alternatively, maybe structure is a binary pass/fail (if invalid, component gets 0), but since it's valid, structure is 100, then the other two aspects contribute to the remaining. 

But the problem states: "each component is scored based on the three aspects". So likely, the scorer needs to assign a score between 0-100 for each component, taking into account structure, accuracy, completeness. 

Given that, for Data:

- Structure: Perfect (all entries are valid JSON, proper structure). So max points here.

- Accuracy: The existing entries are accurate, so 100%.

- Completeness: Missing 4 entries. So completeness is 50% (since 4 out of 8 are present). 

Total score might be calculated as (Structure + Accuracy + Completeness)/3. But perhaps the user expects more nuanced. Alternatively, maybe structure is part of the accuracy/completeness. 

Alternatively, maybe:

Structure contributes 20%, accuracy 40%, completeness 40%? Not sure. Since the instructions don't specify, I'll proceed with assuming each aspect is equally weighted (each third of the score). 

Thus, Data component score: (100 + 100 + 50)/3 = 83.3, so ~83. 

But let me think again. Since the structure is perfect (no penalties), and accuracy is perfect on what's present, but completeness is half. Maybe the total is closer to (Accuracy * completeness) ? 

Alternatively, perhaps the completeness is a penalty on the accuracy. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (number of correct items / total items in GT) * 100 for completeness. 

Since completeness is measured by coverage of GT, then the completeness score is (number of correct GT items present in prediction) / total GT items * 100. Here, they have 4 out of 8, so 50. 

Accuracy is (number of accurate items / number of items in prediction) * 100. Since all their items are accurate, that's 100. 

So maybe the component score is (accuracy + completeness)/2 * structure factor (if structure is 100, then it's just (100+50)/2=75. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the component score to be the minimum of the aspects? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the problem says "the score for each component is based on three evaluation aspects". So perhaps the aspects are considered together. 

Perhaps the best way is to give structure full points (100), then compute accuracy and completeness. 

Accuracy: All the entries in the prediction are accurate, so 100% accuracy. 

Completeness: Half the entries are missing. So if the maximum possible completeness is 100, missing half would deduct 50 points, leading to 50. 

Then, the component score is (structure + accuracy + completeness)/3 → (100+100+50)/3 ≈83.3. 

I think that's reasonable. So Data: ~83. 

Moving on to **Analyses Component:**

First, check structure. The predicted analyses are in valid JSON, proper key-value pairs. Yes. 

Now, check accuracy and completeness. 

Ground truth has 26 analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_26). The predicted has 21 analyses (missing analyses_2, 6, 12, 19, 20? Wait let me count the predicted analyses entries. Let me count the items in the predicted analyses array:

Looking at the predicted analyses:

analysis_1,

analysis_3,

analysis_4,

analysis_5,

analysis_7,

analysis_8,

analysis_9,

analysis_10,

analysis_11,

analysis_13,

analysis_14,

analysis_15,

analysis_16,

analysis_17,

analysis_18,

analysis_20,

analysis_21,

analysis_22,

analysis_23,

analysis_24,

analysis_25,

analysis_26 → that's 22 entries. Wait let me recount:

1. analysis_1

2. analysis_3

3. analysis_4

4. analysis_5

5. analysis_7

6. analysis_8

7. analysis_9

8. analysis_10

9. analysis_11

10. analysis_13

11. analysis_14

12. analysis_15

13. analysis_16

14. analysis_17

15. analysis_18

16. analysis_20

17. analysis_21

18. analysis_22

19. analysis_23

20. analysis_24

21. analysis_25

22. analysis_26

Yes, 22 entries. Ground truth has 26. So missing analyses_2, 6, 12, 19. 

Now checking each analysis in the prediction against ground truth:

Starting with analysis_1:

GT: analysis_1 is Genomics, data [data_1]. Prediction matches. Accurate. 

Analysis_3 in GT is Methylation, data [data_3]. In prediction, it's present. But in the data section, the prediction didn't include data_3. However, the analysis references data_3 which isn't in the data entries of the prediction. Wait, but the analysis's analysis_data can reference data entries even if they're missing? Wait no, the data entries are part of the data component. Since the data_3 is missing from the data section in the prediction, does this matter? 

Wait the note says "Identifiers: Fields such as data_id or analysis_id are unique identifiers only. Do not penalize mismatched IDs if the content is otherwise correct." So even if data_3 is missing from the data array, as long as the analysis references it correctly (as per GT), it's okay? 

Hmm. The problem says "Do not penalize mismatched IDs if the content is otherwise correct." So if the analysis refers to data_3 which exists in the ground truth's data, but not in the predicted data, but the analysis itself is correct, then it's okay. Because the analysis's accuracy is about the relationship (which data it uses). Since the analysis_3 in the prediction has analysis_data ["data_3"], which is correct per ground truth, even though data_3 is missing from the data array, the analysis itself is accurate. 

So we should not penalize the analysis for referencing data that's missing in the data component. Only the data component is penalized for missing data entries. 

Therefore, analysis_3 is accurate. 

Similarly, analysis_5 (proteomics using data_5). The data_5 is missing in data entries, but the analysis itself is correct. 

Proceeding:

Analysis_7: Correlation on data_3 (same as above, but analysis_7's data is data_3, which exists in GT data, so accurate. 

Analysis_8: Correlation on data_2 (but data_2 is missing from the data array, but analysis_8 is referencing it. Since analysis_2 is missing in the analyses array (analysis_2 is in GT but not in prediction), but analysis_8 is present. 

Wait, analysis_2 in GT is Transcriptomics using data_2. The predicted analyses do not have analysis_2, so analysis_8 in prediction references data_2 (from data array missing). 

Wait analysis_8 in prediction is present, but data_2 is missing in the data array. So the analysis_8's data is correct as per GT, but since data_2 isn't in the data array, but the analysis's own entry is correct (as per its own analysis_data pointing to data_2), which is part of the ground truth, so it's accurate. 

Continuing:

Analysis_9: Differential Analysis on data_4 (correct, GT has analysis_10 with sample label, but wait in GT, analysis_10 is Differential Analysis with data_4 and sample label organoids/tumor tissues. Wait looking at GT analysis_10:

analysis_10 in GT is "Differential Analysis", analysis_data ["data_4"], with label {sample: [...]}. 

In the prediction's analysis_10, the analysis_data is ["data_4"], and the label matches. So analysis_10 is accurate. 

Analysis_11: PCA using analysis_2, data_6, data_7, data_8. But analysis_2 is missing in the predicted analyses (since analysis_2 is not present in the prediction's analyses array). Wait the analysis_11 in prediction references analysis_2, which is not present in the prediction's analyses array. 

Wait the analysis_2 is part of the ground truth, but not included in the prediction's analyses. Therefore, the prediction's analysis_11 is referencing an analysis (analysis_2) that exists in GT but not in the predicted analyses. 

Is this an issue? 

The analysis_11 in the prediction's analysis_data includes analysis_2, which is not present in the predicted analyses array. But according to the GT, analysis_2 exists, so if the analysis_11 is supposed to reference it, then in the prediction's analysis_11, including analysis_2 is correct (as per GT), even though analysis_2 itself is missing from the predictions. 

However, since analysis_2 is not present in the prediction's analyses array, the analysis_11's analysis_data includes a reference to an analysis that the prediction hasn't annotated. 

This might be a problem for accuracy. Because the analysis_11 in the prediction is claiming to use analysis_2, which isn't present in their analyses. 

Hmm, this complicates things. 

Alternatively, the analysis's analysis_data can reference analyses that are present in the ground truth, but not in the prediction. Since the analysis_11 in the prediction is supposed to reflect the ground truth, which does include analysis_2, but the prediction missed analysis_2, then the analysis_11's analysis_data including analysis_2 is accurate (because in GT it is correct), even though analysis_2 isn't present in the prediction's analyses. 

Because the analysis's own correctness is about whether it correctly represents the ground truth, not whether the referenced analyses are present in the prediction. 

So in that case, analysis_11 is accurate. 

Proceeding further, let's go step by step through each analysis in the prediction and compare to GT.

1. analysis_1: Correct, matches GT.
2. analysis_3: Correct (methylation on data_3).
3. analysis_4: Proteomics on data_4 (correct).
4. analysis_5: Proteomics on data_5 (correct, though data_5 is missing in data array but analysis is correct).
5. analysis_7: Correlation on data_3 (correct).
6. analysis_8: Correlation on data_2 (correct, as per GT's analysis_8).
7. analysis_9: Correlation on data_4 (matches GT's analysis_9).
8. analysis_10: Differential Analysis on data_4 with label (matches GT's analysis_10).
9. analysis_11: PCA using analysis_2, data_6, data_7, data_8. In GT, analysis_11 uses analysis_2, data_6, data_7, data_8. So yes, accurate. Even though analysis_2 is missing from predictions, the analysis_11's entry itself is accurate per GT.
10. analysis_13: Functional enrichment on analysis_2 etc. Same logic applies; accurate.
11. analysis_14: PCA on analysis_3 (correct).
12. analysis_15: PCA on analysis_2 (correct).
13. analysis_16: PCA on analysis_4 (correct).
14. analysis_17: Consensus clustering with correct data and label (matches GT's analysis_17).
15. analysis_18: Functional Enrichment on the five analyses (matches GT's analysis_18).
16. analysis_20: Regression Analysis with training_set [data1,2,3,4], label. In GT, analysis_20 has training_set [data1,2,3,4], which matches. So accurate.
17. analysis_21: mutation frequencies on analysis_2 (GT has analysis_21 which uses analysis_2. So accurate).
18. analysis_22: differential analysis on analysis_1 (correct).
19. analysis_23: differential analysis on analysis_3 (correct).
20. analysis_24: differential analysis on analysis_2 (correct).
21. analysis_25: differential analysis on analysis_4 (correct).
22. analysis_26: survival analysis on data_7 (GT's analysis_26 uses data_7, correct).

Now the missing analyses in the prediction compared to GT:

GT has analyses_2, 6, 12, 19, and 20? Wait GT analysis_20 is present in prediction as analysis_20. Wait let me check GT analyses:

GT analyses from 1 to 26. The missing ones in the prediction are:

analysis_2 (Transcriptomics on data_2),

analysis_6 (PCA on analysis_2, data6,7,8?), 

analysis_12 (Correlation on analysis_2 etc.), 

analysis_19 (Survival analysis on data_7 with cluster labels),

and analysis_20 in GT is present in prediction as analysis_20. 

Wait, GT analysis_20 is present. So missing are analyses_2, 6, 12, and 19.

Additionally, the prediction has analysis_26 which is correct. 

So total missing analyses: 4.

Now, accuracy for Analyses: 

All the analyses present in the prediction are accurate. Except perhaps analysis_11, which references analysis_2 which isn't present in the prediction, but in GT analysis_2 exists. So the analysis_11's analysis_data is correct as per GT. 

Therefore, accuracy is 100% on the entries present. 

Completeness: 22/26 analyses present. So completeness is (22/26)*100 ≈84.6%. 

Structure: Valid JSON, so full marks. 

Calculating the score similarly to Data:

Structure: 100,

Accuracy: 100,

Completeness: ~84.6. 

Average would be (100+100+84.6)/3 ≈ 94.8. Approximately 95. 

Wait but let me confirm completeness calculation: 22 correct out of 26. So 22/26 is ~84.6%. 

Alternatively, if the user considers that the analyses not present are penalized, so the completeness is 84.6. 

Thus, the score would be around 95. 

Now **Results Component:**

Check structure first. The predicted results are valid JSON. 

Ground truth has 14 results entries. Prediction has 10. 

Need to check each result in prediction against GT. 

First, let's list the GT results:

1. analysis_9 metrics Correlation,R value [0.66], features G6PD,PGD → present in prediction.

2. analysis_9 metrics Correlation,p value [2.8e-9] → present.

3. analysis_9 R 0.79 TKT → present.

4. analysis_9 p 8e-15 TKT → present.

5. analysis_9 R 0.85 TALDO1 → present.

6. analysis_9 p 6.1e-9 TALDO1 → present.

7. analysis_10 P [0.006, 0.026, 0.027, 0.03], features SCAF11 etc. → missing in prediction?

Wait looking at the predicted results:

The predicted results have entries up to analysis_25, but let's see:

Looking at the prediction's results array:

- analysis_9 has six entries (same as GT's first six).

Then:

7. analysis_19 OS,p [6.2e-6] → GT has this as the seventh entry. In the prediction, it's present? Wait in the predicted results:

Looking at the predicted results:

After the analysis_9 entries, next is:

{"analysis_id": "analysis_19", "metrics": "OS,p", "value": [6.2e-6]} → Wait, in the ground truth, analysis_19's result is OS,p [6.2e-6], which is present in the prediction as the 7th entry (index 6 in zero-based). 

Wait the prediction's results array:

The 7th entry (index 6) is indeed analysis_19's OS,p. 

Next in GT, after analysis_19 comes analysis_21 (metrics R, value [0.78,0.69,...], features drugs). 

In prediction's results, next is:

{"analysis_id": "analysis_22", "metrics": "p", ...} which corresponds to analysis_22's p value. 

In GT, the 8th result is analysis_21's R value. 

The prediction's results do not include analysis_21's result (the R metrics with values 0.78 etc.). 

Then in GT, the 9th result is analysis_22's p (present in prediction as analysis_22). 

GT's 10th result: analysis_23's p (present in prediction as analysis_23). 

GT's 11th: analysis_26's OS,p (present in prediction as analysis_26). 

GT's 12th: analysis_24's p (present in prediction as analysis_24). 

GT's 13th: analysis_25's p (present as analysis_25). 

Wait, let me list all GT results:

GT Results entries:

1. analysis_9 (corr R G6PD-PGD)
2. analysis_9 (corr p)
3. analysis_9 (corr R G6PD-TKT)
4. analysis_9 (corr p)
5. analysis_9 (corr R G6PD-TALDO1)
6. analysis_9 (corr p)
7. analysis_10 (P values)
8. analysis_19 (OS,p)
9. analysis_21 (R values for drugs)
10. analysis_22 (p)
11. analysis_23 (p)
12. analysis_26 (OS,p)
13. analysis_24 (p)
14. analysis_25 (p)

Wait counting again:

GT has 14 results. Let's number them 1-14.

Prediction's results have entries:

1-6: same as GT's 1-6 (analysis_9's entries)

7: analysis_19 (GT's 8th entry)

8: analysis_22 (GT's 10th)

9: analysis_23 (GT's 11th)

10: analysis_24 (GT's 13th)

11: analysis_25 (GT's 14th)

Wait wait the prediction's results array has 11 entries? Wait let me recount the predicted results array:

The predicted results array has:

1. analysis_9 (corr R PGD)

2. analysis_9 (corr p PGD)

3. analysis_9 (corr R TKT)

4. analysis_9 (corr p TKT)

5. analysis_9 (corr R TALDO1)

6. analysis_9 (corr p TALDO1)

7. analysis_19 (OS,p)

8. analysis_22 (p)

9. analysis_24 (p)

10. analysis_25 (p)

Wait that's 10 entries. Wait the last entry in the prediction's results is analysis_25. So total 10 entries. 

GT's 14 entries:

Missing in prediction are:

- analysis_10's results (the P values) → GT's 7th entry.

- analysis_21's R values (GT's 9th entry).

- analysis_26's OS,p (GT's 12th entry). Wait no, analysis_26's result is present in prediction? Wait GT's 12th entry is analysis_26's OS,p. 

Wait in the predicted results:

Looking at the predicted results array:

After analysis_25 is the 10th entry. 

Wait let me look again at the predicted results as provided:

The predicted results JSON ends with:

    {
      "analysis_id": "analysis_25",
      "metrics": "p",
      "value": [7.6e-12],
      "features": ["correlation"]
    }
  ]

So total 10 entries. 

Checking which are missing:

GT's analysis_10 (the 7th entry in GT):

analysis_id: analysis_10, metrics "P", value [0.006, 0.026, 0.027, 0.03], features ["SCAF11", "TUBGCP6", "RBM33", "PLEC"]

This is missing in the prediction's results. 

Analysis_21's result (GT's 9th entry): 

analysis_21, metrics R, value [0.78, 0.69, 0.68, 0.03], features ["regorafenib", "sorafenib", "lenvatinib"]

Also missing. 

Analysis_26's result (GT's 12th entry): 

analysis_26, metrics OS,p, value [6.5e-4], features ["G6PD"]

Present? Let me check prediction's results for analysis_26. 

Looking through predicted results, the analysis_26 is not listed. Wait the last entries are analysis_25. Wait in the prediction, analysis_26 is not in the results. 

Wait GT's analysis_26's result is present in GT's results as the 12th entry, but in the prediction's results array, there is no entry for analysis_26. 

So missing entries are analysis_10, analysis_21, analysis_26. 

So missing 3 out of 14 entries. 

Additionally, the prediction has:

analysis_22, analysis_23, analysis_24, analysis_25, but in GT, analysis_24 and 25 are present. 

Wait analysis_22,23,24,25 are all accounted for. 

Wait let me list all missing:

GT has 14 results:

1. analysis_9 (R PGD) → present

2. analysis_9 p PGD → present

3. analysis_9 R TKT → present

4. analysis_9 p TKT → present

5. analysis_9 R TALDO1 → present

6. analysis_9 p TALDO1 → present

7. analysis_10 P → MISSING

8. analysis_19 OS,p → present

9. analysis_21 R → MISSING

10. analysis_22 p → present

11. analysis_23 p → present

12. analysis_26 OS,p → MISSING

13. analysis_24 p → present (as analysis_24 in results?)

Wait in GT, analysis_24 is the "differentially analysis" (analysis_24), and its result is the 13th entry (metrics p, value "p<2.2e-16"). This is present in prediction as analysis_24. 

analysis_25's result (GT's 14th entry) is present in prediction as analysis_25. 

So missing are GT's entries 7 (analysis_10), 9 (analysis_21), and 12 (analysis_26). 

That’s three missing entries. 

Additionally, are there any extra entries in the prediction? No, because the prediction has 10 entries, and the ground truth has 14. The missing ones are 3, so completeness is (11/14)? Wait no, the prediction has 10 entries, but some of them may cover more than one? Wait no, each entry is a separate result. 

Wait the prediction has 10 entries, covering 10 of the 14 GT results. 

Therefore completeness is 10/14 ≈71.4%. 

Accuracy: All the results in the prediction are accurate. 

For example, analysis_26's result is missing in prediction, but that's a completeness issue. 

Wait let's verify each entry in the prediction:

- The first six entries (analysis_9) are accurate. 

- analysis_19's entry is correct. 

- analysis_22's p is correct (GT has analysis_22's p). 

- analysis_23's p is correct. 

- analysis_24's p is correct (though in GT it's analysis_24's p with value "p<2.2e-16", which matches the prediction's "p<2.2e-16". 

- analysis_25's p is correct (value 7.6e-12 matches GT). 

So all the entries present in the prediction are accurate. 

Thus, accuracy is 100%. 

Completeness: 10/14 ≈71.4. 

Structure: Valid JSON, so 100. 

Score calculation: (100 + 100 + 71.4)/3 ≈90.46 → ~90. 

But let me check if the analysis_26's result in GT is indeed missing. The GT's analysis_26 has a result with analysis_id "analysis_26", metrics OS,p, value 6.5e-4, features G6PD. The prediction's results do not have this. So that's a missing entry. 

Therefore, the results component score would be approximately (100+100+71.4)/3 = ~90.46, so 90. 

Putting it all together:

Data: ~83.3 → 83

Analyses: ~94.8 → 95

Results: ~90.4 → 90

But let me verify again for the Analyses' completeness: 22/26 is 84.6, so (100+100+84.6)=284.6 /3≈94.86, so 95.

Final scores:

Data: 83,

Analyses: 95,

Results: 90.

But maybe the user expects rounding differently. Alternatively, perhaps the scores are integers. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the Results completeness: 10/14 is 71.43. 

Alternatively, maybe the missing entries are three, so 14-3=11 present? Wait no, the prediction has 10 entries. 

Wait GT has 14 entries, prediction has 10. So the prediction has 10 correct entries (assuming none are incorrect). Thus completeness is (10/14)*100 ≈71.4. 

So final scores as per my calculations:

Data: (100+100+50)/3= 83.3 → 83

Analyses: (100+100+84.6)= 284.6 → 94.86 → 95

Results: (100+100+71.4)= 271.4 → 90.46 → 90

Thus the final scores would be:

Data: 83,

Analyses: 95,

Results: 90.
