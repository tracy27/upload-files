Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component:**

First, check the structure. The predicted data is an array of objects with the required fields like id, omics, source, link, format, public_id. Looking at the ground truth, some entries have empty fields, which is acceptable. The predicted data seems to follow the same structure. However, looking at the entry for data20, in the prediction, the 'omics' field is "bulk RNA-seq" (lowercase), whereas in the ground truth it's "bulk RNA-seq". That's just a minor case difference but still accurate. Similarly, "single-cell RNA-seq" vs "single cell RNA-seq"—maybe a typo, but probably semantically equivalent. 

Now, checking completeness. The ground truth has 22 data entries, while the prediction lists 10. So there are many missing entries. For example, data_3, data_4, data_5, data_8, data_11, data_12, data_14, data_15, data_16, data_17, data_18, data_21, data_22 are missing. That's a significant number. Each missing entry could deduct points. Also, maybe some duplicates or extra entries? The prediction doesn't seem to have extras beyond what's in the ground truth except maybe data20 and data21 which are present but others are missing. 

Accuracy-wise, most existing entries match. For instance, data_1 matches exactly. Data_2 also matches. Data_6,7,9,10,13,19,20,21 are present correctly. However, the predicted data_12 is missing entirely, so that's a problem. But the ones present do have correct info except formatting issues which are minor. 

So for Data:
Structure is good (JSON is valid, all keys present). Deduct maybe 10% because data_20 has "bulk RNA-seq" in lowercase but that's negligible. 

Completeness is poor since only about half the entries are present. Maybe deduct 60-70 points here. 

Accuracy for existing entries is high except possible minor formatting. So maybe 80 for accuracy. 

Total Data Score: Let's see, structure is 100, accuracy 90, completeness 30 (since 10/22 is ~45%, but penalties for missing entries). Wait, how to calculate? Maybe each missing item reduces completeness by (100/22)*points. But maybe better to estimate: since 12 are missing, so completeness is 10/22 ≈ 45%, so 45 points. But maybe there are some inaccuracies. Wait, actually, the user says to penalize for missing and extra. The prediction has 10 entries, but some may have duplicates? No, they look unique. So maybe completeness is around 45% (10/22), so 45 points. Accuracy is 90 (existing correct). Structure is 100. But the total would be (100 + 90 + 45)/3 = but wait, the scoring criteria say each component gets a score out of 100 based on the three aspects (structure, accuracy, completeness). Wait, no—the user specifies that each component (Data, Analyses, Results) has its own score from 0-100, considering all three aspects (structure, accuracy, completeness) for that component. 

Wait, the scoring criteria state that each component (Data, etc.) gets a single score out of 100 based on the three aspects: structure, accuracy, completeness. So for Data:

Structure: Check if it's valid JSON. Both are valid. Also, each object's key-value structure. The predicted data has all the necessary keys. So structure is perfect. So 100 here.

Accuracy: How accurate are the included entries. Since the existing entries (the 10) mostly match the ground truth's entries, except possibly case differences. For example, data_20's 'omics' is "bulk RNA-seq" vs ground's "bulk RNA-seq"—same thing. Data_19's format is FASTQs in both. So accuracy is high. Maybe 95?

But wait, data_3 in ground truth is "single cell RNA-sequencing", but in the prediction, data_12 isn't there, so existing entries don't include that. Wait, no—prediction includes data_3? Wait, looking back:

In the predicted data array, the entries are data_1, 2, 6,7,9,10,13,19,20,21. Wait, data_3 isn't in the predicted data. Oh right! So for accuracy, the existing entries that are present are accurate, but since some required entries are missing, that affects completeness, not accuracy. Accuracy is about correctness of the ones present. So maybe accuracy is 100 for those present except minor formatting, so maybe 98?

Completeness: The ground truth has 22 data entries. Prediction has 10. So completeness is (10/22)*100 ≈ 45%. But the user says to penalize missing and extra. Since there are no extra entries, only missing, so penalty is (22-10)/22 * 100 = 55% penalty? Not sure. Maybe the formula is (number of correct entries / total GT entries)*100, so 45. But maybe the user expects a more nuanced approach. If the prediction misses several important entries, then completeness is low. So maybe 45 points here.

Total Data Score: Structure 100, Accuracy 100 (assuming minor formatting is okay), Completeness 45. How to combine these? The user says each component's score is based on the three aspects. It's unclear if they are weighted equally or summed. Assuming equal weighting, (100+100+45)/3 ≈ 81.66, so 82? Or maybe each aspect contributes to the overall score. Alternatively, perhaps structure is part of the accuracy/completeness? Hmm. The user instruction says:

For each component, score based on the three aspects (structure, accuracy, completeness). So each aspect is a factor contributing to the component's score. So maybe each aspect is a component of the score. For example, if structure is perfect (100), accuracy is 95, completeness 45, then maybe average them? Or maybe structure is binary (either valid or not), but here it's valid. The user might expect a holistic judgment where structure is critical, but in this case, structure is fine. So perhaps the total score is a combination where completeness is a big factor here because so many entries are missing. Maybe the user considers completeness as a major part, so 45 for completeness, accuracy 95, structure 100. Maybe take the minimum of the three? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe each aspect contributes 33%, so (100 + 95 +45)/3 ≈ 80. So Data score around 80-85.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON, all keys present).

Accuracy: The existing entries are accurate except possibly data_20's "bulk RNA-seq" (lowercase vs original's "bulk RNA-seq"—same, so accurate). So accuracy is 100%.

Completeness: 10/22 ≈ 45.45%. So completeness is 45.

The user says for completeness, count semantically equivalent as valid, so if all present entries are correct, then completeness is based on coverage. So the score would be (number of correct entries / total ground truth entries)*100. So 10/22 ≈45. So the three aspects are each scored, then combined into the component's final score. The instructions aren't clear on whether they are averaged or weighted. Maybe the user expects to multiply them? Or add? Since it's ambiguous, I'll assume equal weight. So (100 + 100 + 45)/3 ≈ 81.66 → 82. Alternatively, maybe structure is part of accuracy? Probably not. Since structure is about validity, which is met here. So maybe the overall Data score is 85? Let's go with 82.

Moving to Analyses:

**Analyses Component:**

First, structure. The predicted analyses have entries with id, analysis_name, analysis_data, and sometimes label. The ground truth also has these. Checking one entry, e.g., analysis_1 in both looks correct. However, in analysis_7 and 9 in ground truth, there's a typo: "data" instead of "analysis_data". In the prediction, are there any such errors? Let me check the predicted analyses:

Looking at the predicted analyses, the analysis_9 entry says "data": ["data_4"], but the correct field should be "analysis_data". That's a structural error. So that's invalid JSON? No, the structure is allowed as long as the keys exist. Wait, no—if the ground truth has "analysis_data", but the prediction uses "data", then that's a key mismatch. So that's a structural error. So analysis_9 in the prediction has wrong key "data" instead of "analysis_data", making it invalid in terms of structure. That's a problem. 

Wait, in the ground truth, analysis_7 is written as {"id": "analysis_7", "analysis_name": "ATAC-seq", "data": ["data_2"]}, which actually has a typo: it should be "analysis_data". So in the ground truth, that's an error too. However, the user says to consider structure based on the given inputs. So if the predicted analyses have that error where they use "data" instead of "analysis_data", then that's a structural issue. Wait, in the predicted analyses:

Looking at the predicted analyses array:

- analysis_9: {"id": "analysis_9", "analysis_name": "ChIP-seq", "data": ["data_4"]} → here "data" is the key instead of "analysis_data". That's incorrect structure. So this is a structural error. So structure for Analyses can't be 100. There's at least one object with wrong key.

Another check: analysis_2 in ground truth has "analysis_data" and "label". The predicted analysis_5 has similar structure. Are all other keys correct? Let me scan through.

Other entries in the prediction seem okay except analysis_9. So structure score would be penalized here. Let's say 10 points off for that error. So structure: 90.

Accuracy: The analyses in prediction need to match the ground truth's analyses in terms of names, linked data, and labels. Let's compare.

First, the ground truth has 22 analyses; prediction has 11. So completeness is an issue here too. But let's focus on accuracy for existing entries.

Analysis_1 in both match. 

Analysis_4 in ground truth is PCA with data from analysis_1, data_5, analysis_3. In the prediction's analysis_4, the analysis_data includes analysis_1, data_5, analysis_3. Wait, but in the prediction's analysis_4, the analysis_data is ["analysis_1", "data_5", "analysis_3"]. However, in the ground truth's analysis_4, the analysis_data is ["analysis_1", "data_5", "analysis_3"], so that's accurate. 

Analysis_5 in both matches: Differential Analysis on analysis_1 with the label. 

Analysis_9 in prediction (which has the key error) references data_4. In ground truth's analysis_9, analysis_9 is ChIP-seq on data_4, so the content is correct, but the key is wrong. So for accuracy, the content is correct, but structure is wrong. 

Analysis_11 in prediction matches the ground truth's analysis_11 (Differential Analysis with HC labels).

Analysis_12 in ground truth is Single cell Transcriptomics on data_3. The prediction's analysis_12 is present as analysis_12, but in the prediction's analyses list, there's an analysis_12? Wait, looking at the predicted analyses:

Wait the predicted analyses array has analysis_1,4,5,9,11,12,15,18,19,21,22. Wait analysis_12 in the prediction is present as:

{"id": "analysis_12", "analysis_name": "Single cell Transcriptomics", "analysis_data": ["data_3"]}. Which matches the ground truth's analysis_12. So yes, that's accurate.

Analysis_15 is PCA on analysis_11, which matches ground truth's analysis_15 (if exists? Wait ground truth's analysis_15 is PCA on analysis_11, yes.

Analysis_18 and 19 are present and correct.

Analysis_21 and 22 are present in prediction as analysis_21 and 22. Ground truth has them as well. 

Wait the prediction's analysis_20 isn't listed? Wait the predicted analyses include up to analysis_22. Let me recount:

The predicted analyses list includes:

analysis_1,

analysis_4,

analysis_5,

analysis_9,

analysis_11,

analysis_12,

analysis_15,

analysis_18,

analysis_19,

analysis_21,

analysis_22 → total 11 entries. Ground truth has 22. So missing many, but focusing on accuracy of existing ones.

Most analyses seem accurate except analysis_9's key error. The content of analysis_9 is correct (ChIP-seq on data_4), but the key is wrong (data instead of analysis_data). Since structure is already penalized, the accuracy here is okay for content.

Therefore, accuracy is high except for the key error, but content-wise, it's correct. So accuracy score: maybe 95, because one entry has a structural error but content is correct. Or does the key error affect accuracy? Since the key is part of structure, maybe accuracy remains 100. Hmm. Since the user separates structure and accuracy, the key error is a structure issue, so accuracy for analysis_9 is okay in terms of content. Thus, accuracy for analyses is 100 except maybe some other discrepancies?

Check another example: analysis_2 in ground truth is Temporal analysis with analysis_data pointing to analysis_1, but in prediction, there's no analysis_2. So the prediction lacks many analyses, but for the ones present, their content is accurate.

Thus, accuracy for existing analyses is good, so 100.

Completeness: The ground truth has 22 analyses; prediction has 11. So 11/22 = 50%. But maybe some of the missing analyses are critical. For instance, analysis_2, 6,7,8,10,13,14,16,17, etc., are missing. Each missing analysis reduces completeness. Since only half are present, completeness score is 50. But maybe some are less important? The user says to penalize for missing. So 50.

Structure: The only structural error is analysis_9's key. So out of 11 analyses, one has a key error. The rest are correct. So structure is mostly good. Let's say 90 (since one out of eleven had an error).

So for Analyses component:

Structure: 90 (due to one entry's key mistake),

Accuracy: 100 (content correct where present),

Completeness: 50 (half present).

Total score: (90 + 100 +50)/3 = 80. So 80?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is docked more. If each analysis must have correct keys, then analysis_9 is invalid, so maybe that analysis is considered invalid, thus reducing completeness? Or is structure a separate factor?

The structure aspect is about the entire component's validity. Since one entry has a wrong key, the structure is not fully valid. So maybe structure is 90 (assuming one error out of 11 entries). So 80 total for Analyses.

**Results Component:**

Ground truth has one result entry with analysis_id analysis_11, features ["IL1RL1", "KRT36", "PIK3CG", "NPY"].

Prediction's results array is empty. 

Structure: The results in prediction are an empty array, which is valid JSON. So structure is 100.

Accuracy: Since there are no results provided, accuracy is 0 (as they didn't capture the existing result).

Completeness: 0 (no entries present).

Thus, Results score would be (100 +0 +0)/3 ≈ 33.3, so 33.

But maybe structure is 100, but since there's nothing, the other factors bring it down. So 33.

Final Scores:

Data: 82,

Analyses: 80,

Results: 33.

Wait but let me recheck:

Wait for Results, the structure is valid (empty array is valid JSON), so structure is 100. Accuracy: since the ground truth has one entry, but prediction has none, so accuracy is 0 (no correct entries). Completeness is 0 (no entries). Thus the three aspects contribute 100 +0 +0 → average 33.3. Rounded to 33.

But maybe the user expects if the component is completely missing, it's worse. But according to criteria, it's based on the aspects. So yes, 33.

So final scores would be:

Data: 82,

Analyses: 80,

Results: 33.

Wait but maybe my calculations were rough. Let me think again.

Alternatively, for Data component:

Structure is perfect (100),

Accuracy: All present entries are accurate (so 100),

Completeness: 10/22 ≈45.45 → 45,

Total: (100+100+45)/3 = 81.66 → 82.

Analyses:

Structure: 90 (due to one key error),

Accuracy: 100,

Completeness: 50 (11/22),

→ (90+100+50)/3 = 80.

Results:

Structure 100,

Accuracy 0,

Completeness 0 → (100+0+0)/3 =33.3 →33.

Thus, the final scores would be:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 82,
        "Analyses": 80,
        "Results": 33
    }
}

But let me verify again for Analyses completeness. The ground truth has 22 analyses; prediction has 11. So 11/22 is exactly 50%, so completeness is 50. 

Also, in the Analyses structure, the key error in analysis_9 is the only structural issue. So structure is 90. 

Yes, that seems right.

However, in the Analyses component, another possible error: analysis_21 and 22 in the prediction reference analysis_20 which is not present in the prediction. Because in the prediction's analyses, there's no analysis_20, yet analysis_21 and 22 mention "analysis_20". Wait looking at the predicted analyses:

Looking at analysis_21:

{"id": "analysis_21", "analysis_name": "Single cell Clustering", "analysis_data": ["data_16", "analysis_20"]}

analysis_22: {"id": "analysis_22", "analysis_name": "Differential analysis", "analysis_data": ["data_16", "analysis_20"]}

But analysis_20 is not present in the predicted analyses list. In the ground truth, analysis_20 is part of the analyses. The prediction missed including analysis_20. Therefore, the references to analysis_20 in analysis_21 and 22 are invalid because analysis_20 isn't present. 

This is an accuracy issue because the analysis_data points to non-existent analysis_20. Hence, those entries are inaccurate. 

So for accuracy in Analyses:

The analysis_21 and 22 have analysis_data referencing analysis_20 which is missing. So those two analyses are partially incorrect. 

How many analyses are there in the prediction? 11. Out of those, two have invalid references. 

Let's reassess accuracy:

Of the 11 analyses in prediction:

- analysis_1: ok

- analysis_4: ok

- analysis_5: ok

- analysis_9: content ok, but key error (structure issue)

- analysis_11: ok

- analysis_12: ok

- analysis_15: ok

- analysis_18: ok

- analysis_19: ok

- analysis_21: has analysis_20 which doesn't exist → inaccurate

- analysis_22: same issue → inaccurate

So two out of 11 analyses have accuracy issues. 

Each analysis has multiple aspects, but the key inaccuracy here is the reference to analysis_20 which is missing. So accuracy for these two is wrong. 

Assuming each analysis is equally weighted, the accuracy would be (9/11)*100 ≈ 81.8, so ~82. 

Plus the structural error in analysis_9 (but that's a structure issue). 

Wait, the accuracy is about factual consistency. So for analysis_21 and 22, their analysis_data includes analysis_20 which isn't present, making them inaccurate. Thus, their accuracy is incorrect. 

Hence, accuracy score for Analyses is (9/11)*100 ≈81.8. So 82.

Then, the accuracy is 82, structure 90, completeness 50. 

Total: (82 + 90 +50)/3 ≈ 74. So 74 for Analyses?

Wait, now this complicates things. I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, the presence of analysis_21 and 22 without analysis_20 makes them have incorrect data links. So their accuracy is wrong. So two entries are inaccurate. So accuracy is (9/11)*100≈81.8. 

Hence, the accuracy part is 82, structure 90, completeness 50. Total (82+90+50)/3 ≈ 74. 

Hmm, that's a significant drop. Maybe I missed this earlier.

Similarly, analysis_21 refers to data_16, which is present in the data section of the ground truth (data_16 exists in GT but not in the prediction's data entries. Wait, data_16 is part of the ground truth's data but not included in the prediction's data array. 

Looking at the data in the prediction: the data entries are up to data21, but data_16 is in GT but not in prediction. 

So in analysis_21 and 22, the analysis_data includes "data_16" which is not present in the prediction's data. 

Wait, the data_16 is in the ground truth's data array, but the prediction did not include data_16. So the analysis_21 in the prediction references data_16, which is missing from the data section. Thus, the analysis's data link is invalid because data_16 isn't present in the data array of the prediction. 

This is another inaccuracy. So analysis_21 and 22 have two invalid references: data_16 (missing from data) and analysis_20 (missing from analyses). 

Thus, those analyses are entirely inaccurate because their dependencies are missing. 

This means two analyses (21 and 22) are completely inaccurate, and another analysis (analysis_20 is missing, but it's not in the prediction anyway). 

Additionally, analysis_9's data key is wrong but the content is correct. 

This adds more inaccuracies. 

Therefore, accuracy calculation needs to consider dependencies between analyses and data. 

This is getting complex. Perhaps I should reassess the Analyses accuracy more carefully.

The analyses in prediction are:

1. analysis_1: ok

2. analysis_4: ok

3. analysis_5: ok

4. analysis_9: content correct (references data_4 which exists?), but key error (structure issue)

Wait data_4 in ground truth is present, but is data_4 present in the prediction's data? 

Looking at the predicted data entries: the data entries are data_1,2,6,7,9,10,13,19,20,21. Data_4 is part of ground truth's data but not in the prediction. 

Thus, analysis_9 (ChIP-seq on data_4) references a data entry (data_4) that is not present in the predicted data array. 

So analysis_9 is inaccurate because it refers to a missing data entry. 

Therefore, analysis_9 is also inaccurate. 

So now, analysis_9 is inaccurate (data_4 missing in data), and analyses 21,22 have two issues each. 

So total inaccurate analyses:

analysis_9: inaccurate (data_4 missing),

analysis_21: data_16 and analysis_20 missing,

analysis_22: same as 21,

Total of 3 analyses out of 11 are inaccurate. 

So accuracy is (8/11)*100 ≈72.7, so ~73. 

Now structure was 90 (due to key error in analysis_9), but analysis_9's content is also inaccurate due to missing data. 

So the accuracy drops further. 

This makes the Analyses score lower. 

This shows how interconnected the components are; missing data entries affect analyses accuracy. 

This complicates things. Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to make a best-effort assessment.

Considering all these dependencies, the Analyses accuracy might be around 70, structure 90, completeness 50. 

So (70+90+50)/3 = 70. 

Alternatively, it's getting too granular, maybe I'll stick to initial calculation but note the deductions.

Alternatively, the user might consider that the analysis_9's content is incorrect because data_4 is missing from data, so accuracy docked. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the initial scores were too optimistic. 

Perhaps the Analyses score is lower. 

But to proceed, I'll proceed with the initial calculation but note deductions for the dependencies. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a more lenient approach where as long as the analysis_data references exist in the provided data/analyses sections, even if they're missing. 

But the problem states "accuracy based on semantic equivalence with ground truth". So if the ground truth's analysis_9 references data_4 which is present in its data, but in the prediction, data_4 isn't there, then the analysis_9 is inaccurate. 

This is getting too involved. To save time, I'll proceed with the initial scores but adjust for the obvious issues:

- Analyses_21 and 22 reference missing analysis_20 and data_16. So two analyses are totally wrong (0 accuracy for them). analysis_9 is wrong because data_4 is missing. 

Thus, 3/11 analyses are inaccurate. So accuracy is (8/11)*100≈73. 

Structure: analysis_9 has a key error (data vs analysis_data) → 10% deduction, so 90.

Completeness: 50.

Total: (73 +90 +50)/3 ≈ 71 → 71.

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key error in analysis_9 is a structure issue, so accuracy remains at 73. 

This is tough. Given the time, I'll present the initial scores but note the potential deductions. 

Final Scores:

Data: 82,

Analyses: 80 (or 70?), 

Results: 33.

Probably better to go with the first calculation but acknowledge that the Analyses accuracy is lower. Maybe 70 for Analyses.

Alternatively, let me think again:

The user's instructions say to penalize for missing objects. So in analyses, the missing analyses in the prediction reduce completeness. The accuracy is about the existing ones being correct. 

For the existing analyses:

- analysis_9: has a structural error (key) and references missing data_4 → inaccurate. 

- analysis_21 and 22: references missing analysis_20 and data_16 → inaccurate.

Thus, out of 11 analyses in prediction:

- 3 are inaccurate (analysis_9,21,22),

- 8 are accurate (others).

Accuracy is 8/11 ≈72.7 → ~73.

Structure: 90 (one key error),

Completeness: 50.

Total: (73 +90+50)/3 = ~71 → 71.

But let's do precise math:

(73 +90 +50)=213 → 213/3=71.

So Analyses score 71.

Data: 82,

Analyses:71,

Results:33.

Alternatively, perhaps the key error in analysis_9 is a structure issue, so accuracy is 73 (without the key error affecting it), and structure is 90.

Thus, keeping the calculations as such, I think the initial scores were slightly overestimating, so adjusting Analyses to 70.

Final answer as per initial calculation but considering the deductions, I'll present the following scores:

Data: 80,

Analyses: 70,

Results:30.

Alternatively, the precise calculation leads to:

Data: 82,

Analyses: 71,

Results:33.

But the user wants integer values, so rounding:

Data:82 →80,

Analyses:71→70,

Results:33→30 or 33.

To stay close, I'll go with:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 82,
        "Analyses": 70,
        "Results": 33
    }
}

But perhaps the user expects more rounded numbers. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. 

Alternatively, let's try again for Analyses:

Structure: analysis_9 has a key error ("data" instead of "analysis_data"). That's a structure error, so structure score: 100 - (1/11)*100≈90.9. Let’s say 90.

Accuracy: of the 11 analyses:

- analysis_9: the content (ChIP-seq on data_4) is correct if data_4 existed, but since it's missing from the data, it's inaccurate. 

- analyses_21 and 22: references to analysis_20 (missing) and data_16 (missing in data) → both parts wrong. So these analyses are completely wrong. 

Thus, 3 analyses are inaccurate (9/11 accurate). 

Accuracy: (8/11)*100≈72.7 →73.

Completeness: 11/22=50.

Thus total: (90+73+50)/3 = 71. So 71.

Data: 82,

Analyses:71,

Results:33.

Final JSON:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 82,
        "Analyses": 71,
        "Results": 33
    }
}

But the user might prefer whole numbers without decimals, so rounding to nearest whole number:

Analyses:71 →70 or 71.

I think I’ll proceed with this.
</think>

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 82,
        "Analyses": 71,
        "Results": 33

### Explanation:
#### **Data Component**
- **Structure**: 100/100  
  Valid JSON format with all required fields present. Minor differences in casing (e.g., "bulk RNA-seq" vs. "Bulk RNA-sequencing") are acceptable and do not affect structural validity.
  
- **Accuracy**: 100/100  
  All included entries match the ground truth in content. Formatting differences (e.g., "FASTQs" vs. "FASTQ") are semantically equivalent and not penalized.
  
- **Completeness**: 45/100  
  Only 10 of 22 ground-truth data entries are present. Missing entries include critical datasets like data_3, data_4, data_5, data_8, etc., resulting in a significant coverage gap.

---

#### **Analyses Component**
- **Structure**: 90/100  
  Most analyses are properly formatted. One entry (`analysis_9`) incorrectly uses `"data"` instead of `"analysis_data"`, causing a minor structural flaw.

- **Accuracy**: 73/100  
  While most analyses match the ground truth in name and dependencies, three analyses (`analysis_9`, `analysis_21`, `analysis_22`) reference missing data/analysis entries (e.g., `data_4`, `analysis_20`, `data_16`), reducing accuracy.

- **Completeness**: 50/100  
  Only 11 of 22 ground-truth analyses are included. Key analyses like `analysis_2`, `analysis_6`, and `analysis_13` are absent, halving the coverage.
