Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component: data, analyses, and results. Each has structure, completeness, and accuracy scores.

First, let's tackle the Data component.

**Data Section:**

Groundtruth Data has 3 entries:
1. RNA-seq (data_1)
2. ATAC-seq (data_2)
3. Proteomics (data_3)

Annotation Result Data has 2 entries:
1. WES (data_1) 
2. Gene expression (data_3)

Comparing them:

Structure (10 points):
- Groundtruth uses all required keys: omics, link, format, source, public_id.
- Annotation's entries also have these keys, so structure is correct. Full 10 points here.

Completeness (40 points):
- Groundtruth has 3 sub-objects. Annotation has 2.
- Missing data_2 (ATAC-seq). So minus 10 (since each missing is -10? Wait, no. Wait, the instructions say deduct points for missing any sub-object. Each sub-object missing would be a penalty. Since there are 3 in groundtruth, each missing one deducts (40/3)? Hmm, maybe better to consider each missing sub-object as a portion. Alternatively, since the total is 40, maybe per sub-object 40 divided by number of groundtruth sub-objects. Let me think again.

Wait the instructions say: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object." So each missing sub-object reduces the completeness score. Since the groundtruth has 3 sub-objects, each missing one would deduct (40 / 3 ≈13.33). But since the user might expect integer points, perhaps deduct 10 per missing. Alternatively, maybe each sub-object contributes equally towards the 40, so 40 divided by 3 gives about 13.33 per. But the exact way isn't specified. Maybe it's simpler: if the groundtruth has N sub-objects, then each missing one is (40/N)*1. Here N=3, so each missing is 40/3≈13.33. Since they're missing 1, deduct ~13.33, so completeness becomes 40-13.33≈26.67. But maybe the user expects rounding to whole numbers, so 27? Or perhaps each missing sub-object is a fixed amount, like 10 points each. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume that each missing sub-object takes away 13.33 (so total possible 40 for 3, so 40/3 per missing). 

But in the example, if missing two, it would be 40 - 2*(40/3)= ~13.33. Alternatively, maybe each missing sub-object is worth (total points)/number of groundtruth sub-objects. So for data, 3 sub-objects, each worth 40/3 ≈13.33. So missing 1 would lose ~13.33. Also, the extra sub-objects in the annotation beyond the groundtruth? The annotation has an extra sub-object compared to groundtruth? Wait no, the groundtruth has 3, and the annotation has 2. Wait no, actually, the annotation has 2 data entries, which is less than groundtruth's 3. So no extras. So only deduction for missing. Thus completeness would be 40 - 13.33 ≈26.67.

Accuracy (50 points):

Now, check the existing sub-objects in the annotation against the groundtruth's. 

For data_1 in both:
Groundtruth: RNA-seq, source SRA, public_id PRJNA859010
Annotation: WES, source TCGA, public_id empty.

Here, the omics type is incorrect (WES vs RNA-seq), source wrong (TCGA vs SRA), and public_id missing. All keys have wrong info except maybe link and format (which are empty in groundtruth too, so format in annotation is "Raw proteome data" which might be irrelevant here). So this sub-object is semantically mismatched. Therefore, this doesn't count as a match. 

Next, data_3 in both:
Groundtruth: proteomics data from ProteomeXchange Consortium (PXD035459)
Annotation: Gene expression profiles from biosino NODE, public_id empty.

Again, omics is different (gene expression vs proteomics), source different. Not a match.

So none of the annotation's data sub-objects correspond semantically to groundtruth's. Therefore, all existing sub-objects are incorrect. Since there are no correctly matched sub-objects, the accuracy score for data would be 0 (since all the present ones are wrong and they missed some). 

Wait but accuracy is only for the matched sub-objects. Since none are matched, then the accuracy part (50 points) would be zero? Because they didn't have any correct sub-objects to assess accuracy on. So yes.

Total Data Score:
Structure: 10
Completeness: ~26.67 (approx 27)
Accuracy: 0
Total ≈ 10+26.67+0 = 36.67 → rounded to 37?

But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express:

Alternatively, maybe for completeness, each missing sub-object (3 total) is worth 40/3 each. So missing 1: 40 - (1*40/3) = 40 -13.33=26.67

Accuracy: Since none of the existing sub-objects match, even though they have 2 entries, those don't count as matched, so accuracy is 0. Thus total is 10 +26.67 +0=36.67, which would be 37 when rounded. 

Moving on to Analyses section.

**Analyses Section:**

Groundtruth has 7 analyses:
analysis_1 to analysis_8 (wait actually up to 8, but let me check:

Groundtruth analyses list: analysis_1 (ATAC), analysis_2 (RNA), analysis_4 (Proteome), analysis_5 (Diff expr), analysis_6 (GO), analysis_7 (Diff expr for Proteome?), analysis_8 (GO again).

So 7 analyses in total.

Annotation's analyses has 6 entries: analysis_1, 2,4,5,6,8. 

Wait looking at the annotation's analyses:

[
    analysis_1 (ATAC),
    analysis_2 (Spatial metabolomics),
    analysis_4 (Prediction TF),
    analysis_5 (overrepresentation analysis),
    analysis_6 (Gene ontology...),
    analysis_8 (Proteomics)
]

So 6 analyses. The groundtruth had 7. So missing analysis_7 (the second differential expr for proteome analysis). 

Structure (10 points):
Check if each analysis has correct keys. 

In groundtruth, each analysis has analysis_name, analysis_data, and sometimes label. The annotation's analyses:

Looking at each:

analysis_1 in annotation has analysis_name and analysis_data, which is correct. 

analysis_2 has analysis_name and analysis_data. 

analysis_4 has analysis_data as ["data_11"], but that might be a problem because data_11 isn't present in their data section (their data has data_1 and data_3). But structure-wise, the keys are okay. 

analysis_5: analysis_name, analysis_data (["analysis_8"]), and label is empty string instead of an object. Wait groundtruth's analysis_5 has label as object with group array. In annotation, it's "label": "" which is invalid. So that breaks structure. 

Wait structure requires the keys to be properly formatted. The label should be an object, but here it's a string. That's a structural error. 

Also, analysis_8 in the annotation has analysis_data pointing to analysis_7, which may not exist in their own analyses. But structurally, the keys are present (analysis_name and analysis_data). However, the label in analysis_5 is not a valid structure (since it's a string instead of an object). So that's a structure issue. 

Therefore, the structure is not perfect. 

Let me check each analysis in the annotation:

analysis_1: structure ok (keys correct).
analysis_2: keys ok.
analysis_4: keys ok.
analysis_5: analysis_name, analysis_data, and label (but label is a string, not an object). That's a structure error. So this sub-object has invalid structure for label.
analysis_6: structure ok.
analysis_8: structure ok.

Thus, one sub-object (analysis_5) has incorrect structure. So structure points: 10 minus some. How much?

The structure section is worth 10 total. If any sub-object has structural issues, deduct points. Since one out of 6 analyses has an error (analysis_5's label is a string instead of object), maybe deduct 2 points (assuming per error). Or maybe structure is about the entire object's structure. Since the analyses array has an element with an invalid label key (should be object but is string), the structure is flawed. So maybe deduct 2 points for structure, making it 8/10?

Alternatively, maybe the entire structure is considered broken. But the problem says "structure should have correct JSON structure and proper key-value pairs". So if a key has wrong type (like label being a string instead of object), that's a structure error. Since only one sub-object has this, maybe subtract 2 points (10 - 2 = 8).

Completeness (40 points):

Groundtruth has 7 analyses. Annotation has 6. Missing analysis_7. 

Each missing sub-object would deduct (40/7)*1 ≈5.71 points. 

Additionally, check if any extra sub-objects in annotation are not justified. 

Looking at the annotation's analyses:

analysis_2 (Spatial metabolomics) – not present in groundtruth. 

analysis_4 (Prediction TF) – not in groundtruth (groundtruth had analysis_4 as Proteome analysis, but content different). 

analysis_5 (overrepresentation analysis) – groundtruth had analysis_5 as Differential expr, but here it's overrepresentation. 

Wait, but for completeness, we need to see if the annotation's sub-objects are semantically equivalent to any in groundtruth. 

Wait the instruction says: "sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not totally identical may still qualify as matches. Thoroughly analyze each groundtruth sub-object's semantic correspondence."

So first, need to map which of the annotation's analyses correspond to groundtruth's.

Groundtruth analyses:

analysis_1: ATAC-seq analysis (matches annotation's analysis_1 name exactly, and links to data_2 which exists in groundtruth, but in the annotation's data, data_2 isn't present (they have data_1 and data_3). Wait in the annotation's analysis_1's analysis_data is ["data_2"], but in their data section, data_2 isn't listed. Their data entries are data_1 (WES) and data_3 (gene expression). So the data_2 referenced in analysis_1 doesn't exist in their data. But for completeness, maybe we don't consider data references yet; that's part of accuracy? Or structure?

Wait for completeness, it's just about whether the sub-object exists in terms of semantic correspondence. 

analysis_1 in both: same name. So that counts as a match. 

analysis_2 in groundtruth: RNA-seq analysis (analysis_2) vs annotation's analysis_2 is Spatial metabolomics. Not semantically related. So no match.

analysis_4 in groundtruth: Proteome analysis (analysis_4) vs annotation's analysis_4 is Prediction of transcription factors. Different, so no match.

analysis_5 in groundtruth: Diff expr analysis (linked to analysis_2) vs annotation's analysis_5 is overrepresentation analysis (linked to analysis_8 which isn't in their analyses? Wait in the annotation's analysis_5, analysis_data is ["analysis_8"], but analysis_8 exists in their list, but analysis_8 in their case is linked to analysis_7. But regardless, the names are different. So no match between groundtruth analysis_5 and annotation's analysis_5.

analysis_6 in groundtruth: GO enrichment (from analysis_5) vs annotation's analysis_6: same name (Gene ontology enrichment analysis). The groundtruth's analysis_6 is connected to analysis_5 (diff expr), while the annotation's analysis_6 is connected to analysis_5 (overrepresentation). The name is same, so maybe counts as a match? 

Similarly, analysis_7 in groundtruth is another diff expr (for proteome), linked to analysis_4 (proteome data). The annotation has no such analysis. 

analysis_8 in groundtruth is GO enrichment from analysis_7 vs annotation's analysis_8 is Proteomics analysis linked to analysis_7 (which is not present in their analyses, but maybe the name is different). 

So let's try mapping:

Groundtruth analyses mapped to annotation:

analysis_1: matched (same name)

analysis_2: no match (annotation's analysis_2 is different)

analysis_4: no match (different)

analysis_5: no match (different name)

analysis_6: possibly matches annotation's analysis_6 (same name)

analysis_7: no match (annotation lacks this)

analysis_8: possibly matches annotation's analysis_8? Name is different (annotation's analysis_8 is "Proteomics" vs groundtruth's analysis_8 is "Gene ontology enrichment"). No, not same.

So total matched analyses from groundtruth to annotation are analysis_1 and analysis_6. 

Wait analysis_6 in groundtruth is "Gene ontology enrichment analysis" which matches exactly with annotation's analysis_6. Even though their dependencies differ, the name is same. So that's a match. 

analysis_8 in groundtruth is "Gene ontology enrichment analysis" again? Wait no, groundtruth's analysis_8 is "Gene ontology enrichment analysis" (same as analysis_6?), but looking back:

Groundtruth's analyses:

analysis_6: "Gene ontology enrichment analysis" from analysis_5

analysis_8: "Gene ontology enrichment analysis" from analysis_7

So both are same name. The annotation's analysis_6 has the same name. So that's a match for analysis_6, but what about analysis_8 in groundtruth? There's no corresponding analysis in annotation with that name except analysis_8 is named "Proteomics".

Therefore, only two analyses (analysis_1 and analysis_6) are semantically matched. 

The groundtruth has 7 analyses, so missing 5 (analysis_2, analysis_4, analysis_5, analysis_7, analysis_8). But wait, actually, analysis_6 and analysis_1 are matched, so 2 matches. The other 5 are missing. 

Wait no, the groundtruth has 7 analyses. The annotation's analyses have 6, but only 2 of them match semantically. The other 4 (analysis_2,4,5,8 in annotation) do not correspond to any in groundtruth. But the completeness is about how many groundtruth sub-objects are missing in the annotation. 

Completeness scoring: For each groundtruth sub-object, if not present in the annotation (even if the annotation has extra ones), you deduct. The penalty is (40/7)*number of missing. 

Wait the instruction says: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical may still qualify as matches. [...] Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

So first, we need to see how many of the groundtruth's analyses are missing in the annotation. 

Groundtruth analyses (7):

1. analysis_1 (matched)
2. analysis_2 (not matched)
3. analysis_4 (not matched)
4. analysis_5 (not matched)
5. analysis_6 (matched)
6. analysis_7 (not matched)
7. analysis_8 (not matched)

So missing 5 sub-objects (analysis_2,4,5,7,8). Each missing one would deduct (40/7) per. 

40 - (5 * (40/7)) ≈ 40 - 28.57 ≈11.43. But maybe they deduct per missing, so 5* (40/7) ≈28.57 deducted, so completeness is 40 -28.57 ≈11.43. 

Additionally, the extra analyses (analysis_2,4,5,8 in annotation that don't correspond) might get penalized. The instruction says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

How many extra? The annotation has 6 analyses. Of those, 2 are matches (analysis_1 and 6), so the remaining 4 are extra. So 4 extra sub-objects. Each could deduct points. How much?

The total completeness is 40. The penalty for extras: maybe each extra is (40/7) as well? Or a fixed amount. Since the instruction isn't clear, perhaps deduct half the value of the missing ones? Alternatively, since the total is 40, and the extra adds to the count beyond the groundtruth's, maybe each extra is penalized similarly. 

Alternatively, the penalty for extra sub-objects could be (number of extra)*(40/(groundtruth_count + extra))? Not sure. Maybe the user expects that for completeness, we only deduct for missing ones and ignore extras unless specified. The initial instruction says "deduct points for missing any sub-object". The note mentions that extra may incur penalties, but the main deduction is for missing. 

Assuming the penalty is only for missing, then completeness is around 11.43. But that seems very low, but given that 5 out of 7 are missing, that's accurate. 

But maybe the calculation is different. Let me recast:

Total completeness points: 40. For each missing groundtruth sub-object (5), subtract (40/7) each. So 40 - (5*(40/7)) ≈ 11.43.

Then, for extra sub-objects (4), if they are penalized, perhaps each extra deducts (40/7) as well, leading to further deductions. But the instruction says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance". Since the example's extra analyses are not semantically related, they are contextually irrelevant, so maybe deducting them. 

Total extra:4, so adding (4*(40/7)) ≈22.86. Total deduction would be (5+4)* (40/7)= 9*(40/7)= 51.43, which exceeds 40. That can't be. 

Hmm, perhaps the penalty for extra is separate. Maybe completeness is capped at 40, and extra sub-objects don't add to the penalty beyond the missing ones. The instruction might mean that extras don't help but aren't penalized unless they are redundant or conflicting. Since the user says "depending on contextual relevance", but without more info, maybe focus on missing first. 

Proceeding with 11.43 for completeness. Approximately 11.

Accuracy (50 points):

Now, for the matched sub-objects (analysis_1 and analysis_6):

Analysis_1 in groundtruth: 

analysis_data is ["data_2"] (which refers to ATAC-seq data in data_2). In the annotation's analysis_1, analysis_data is ["data_2"], but in their data section, they don't have data_2. Their data entries are data_1 (WES) and data_3 (gene expression). So the data_2 referenced here doesn't exist. But for accuracy, we look at the key-value pairs' semantic correctness. 

The analysis_1's analysis_data links to a non-existent data entry in the annotation. That's an accuracy error. Also, the analysis name is correct ("ATAC-seq analysis"), but the linked data is invalid. 

Analysis_6 in groundtruth: 

Groundtruth analysis_6 is linked to analysis_5 (differential expr). In the annotation's analysis_6, it's linked to analysis_5 (overrepresentation analysis). The name is correct ("Gene ontology enrichment analysis"), but the linked analysis_data is different. 

Accuracy for analysis_1:

Name is correct (+). analysis_data is pointing to data_2 which isn't present in their data. That's a discrepancy. So partial marks?

Since the key-value pairs include analysis_data, which is incorrect, this would deduct points. 

Accuracy for analysis_6:

Name is correct. analysis_data is linked to analysis_5 (in their case, overrepresentation), whereas groundtruth links to analysis_5 (diff expr). The linked analysis is different (though the overrepresentation might be part of the pathway?), but the dependency chain is altered. This could be considered inaccurate. 

So each matched sub-object has inaccuracies. 

Calculating accuracy:

Each matched sub-object contributes to the 50 points. There are 2 matched analyses. 

Each sub-object's accuracy is evaluated. 

For analysis_1:

- analysis_name: correct (no deduction)
- analysis_data: incorrect (points deducted). Since the data_2 doesn't exist, this is a major error. Maybe deduct 25 (half of 50?) but per sub-object.

Wait the total accuracy is 50 points. For each matched sub-object, each key's accuracy is assessed. 

Alternatively, the 50 points are distributed across all matched sub-objects. 

Suppose each matched analysis has equal weight. Since there are 2 matched analyses, each could contribute 25 points (50/2). 

For analysis_1:

analysis_data is incorrect (wrong data link). So maybe deduct all 25 for this sub-object. 

analysis_name is correct, but the data link is wrong. So maybe half? Or full deduction? 

If the data linkage is critical, maybe full deduction for that key. 

Alternatively, per key: 

analysis_name is correct (no deduction). 

analysis_data: wrong (so deduct points for that key). 

If the analysis_data is a key that's important, then this would deduct significantly. 

Assuming analysis_data is a key that must be correct, then analysis_1's accuracy is 0 (since data link is wrong). 

Analysis_6:

analysis_name is correct. analysis_data links to analysis_5 (overrepresentation), but in groundtruth it should be analysis_5 (diff expr). The dependency is different. 

Thus, analysis_data is incorrect. So similar to analysis_1, maybe this sub-object's accuracy is 0. 

Total accuracy: 0 (both sub-objects have critical errors). 

Thus, accuracy score is 0. 

Total Analyses Score:

Structure: 8 (due to analysis_5's label being a string instead of object)
Completeness: ~11.43 (approx 11)
Accuracy: 0
Total ≈ 8 + 11 + 0 = 19

Hmm, that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait structure: was the structure issue only in analysis_5's label? Yes. So maybe structure is 10 - 2 =8. 

Completeness: 40 - (5*(40/7)) ≈11.43. 

Accuracy: 0. So total 19.43 ≈19.

Proceeding to Results section.

**Results Section:**

Groundtruth Results have 5 entries:

1. analysis_1 (features: regions, B cells types)
2. analysis_5 (genes list)
3. analysis_2 (some genes)
4. analysis_6 (pathways)
5. analysis_8 (another pathways)

Annotation's Results have 3 entries:

1. analysis_1 (same features as groundtruth?)
2. analysis_3 (has metrics "recall" and features with random strings)
3. analysis_7 (F1 score and features with random strings)

Structure (10 points):

Check each result entry's keys: analysis_id, metrics, value, features.

All entries in annotation have these keys. 

analysis_3 and 7 are mentioned, but their analysis_ids refer to analyses that may not exist in the annotation's analyses (analysis_3 isn't listed in their analyses array). But structurally, the keys are correct. 

So structure is okay. 10/10.

Completeness (40 points):

Groundtruth has 5 results. Annotation has 3. 

Missing 2: analysis_5, analysis_2, analysis_6, analysis_8? Wait groundtruth has 5 results:

Looking at the groundtruth results:

analysis_1 (okay in annotation)

analysis_5 (missing in annotation's results)

analysis_2 (missing in annotation's results)

analysis_6 (missing)

analysis_8 (missing)

So missing 4 results. Wait groundtruth has 5, and the annotation has 3. So missing 2? Wait no, let me recount:

Groundtruth results are:

- analysis_1,

- analysis_5,

- analysis_2,

- analysis_6,

- analysis_8 → total 5.

Annotation's results are:

- analysis_1,

- analysis_3 (doesn't exist in groundtruth),

- analysis_7 (doesn't exist in groundtruth).

Thus, missing 4 (analysis_5,2,6,8). 

Each missing deducts (40/5)=8 per. 

4 missing → deduct 4*8=32 → 40-32=8 points left.

Additionally, the annotation has two extra results (analysis_3 and 7), which are not present in groundtruth. These may incur penalties. 

Extra sub-objects: 2. 

Depending on context, but since they reference analyses not in the groundtruth (analysis_3 and 7 are not in the groundtruth's analyses either), they’re likely irrelevant. Deduct per extra. 

If each extra deducts (40/5)=8, then 2*8=16. Total deduction:32+16=48 → 40-48=negative, which isn’t possible. So perhaps the penalty is only for missing. The instruction says "extra may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance". Assuming that they do, but since completeness is capped at 0, maybe max deduction is 40. 

Alternatively, just deduct for missing: 4 missing → 8*4=32 deducted → 8 points. 

Accuracy (50 points):

Evaluate matched results (only analysis_1 is present in both). 

Groundtruth's analysis_1 result has features ["10,657...", "naive B cells", "CSM B cells"].

Annotation's analysis_1 has the same features. So the features are correct. 

Metrics and value are both empty in groundtruth and annotation. So no difference there. 

Thus, this sub-object is accurate. 

Other results in annotation (analysis_3 and 7) are not semantically matched to any in groundtruth, so not counted. 

Thus, accuracy is based only on analysis_1's result. 

The accuracy score is 50 points for all matched sub-objects. Since only one is matched:

The features are correct (same as groundtruth), metrics and value are empty (which matches groundtruth's empty). So this sub-object is fully accurate. 

Thus, accuracy score is 50. 

Total Results Score:

Structure: 10

Completeness: 8 (due to missing 4, each 8 points deducted: 40 - 32 =8)

Accuracy: 50

Total:10+8+50=68

Putting it all together:

Data: approx 37 (10+26.67+0)

Analyses: ~19.43 (~19)

Results: 68

But let me verify calculations again for precision.

Recalculating Data:

Completeness: 3 groundtruth, 2 in annotation. Missing 1 → deduct 40/3 ≈13.33 → 40-13.33=26.67. 

Thus Data total: 10+26.67+0=36.67 → 37.

Analyses:

Completeness: 7 GT, 2 matched (so 5 missing). Deduct 5*(40/7)=~28.57 → 40-28.57≈11.43. 

Adding structure 8 and accuracy 0: 8+11.43=19.43.

Results:

Completeness: 5 GT, 1 matched (analysis_1). Missing 4 → deduct 4*(40/5)=32 → 8 left. 

Plus extras (2) but assuming only missing count, so 8. 

Accuracy:50. 

Thus final scores:

Data: 37

Analyses:19.43 (~20?)

Results:68

But the user wants integer values. Rounding:

Data: 37

Analyses: 19 or 20?

Maybe 19.43 is ~19.

Final Scores:

{
    "Data": 37,
    "Analyses": 19,
    "Results": 68
}

Wait but let me check the Analyses completeness again. Groundtruth has 7 analyses. The annotation has 6, but only 2 of them are semantically matching. The missing count is 5 (since 7-2=5). So yes.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the analyses. Let me double-check:

Groundtruth analyses:

1. analysis_1 (ATAC): matched with annotation's analysis_1 (same name, so yes)

2. analysis_2 (RNA-seq analysis): not matched (annotation's analysis_2 is different)

3. analysis_4 (Proteome analysis): not matched

4. analysis_5 (Diff expr): not matched (annotation's analysis_5 is overrepresentation)

5. analysis_6 (GO): matched with annotation's analysis_6 (same name)

6. analysis_7 (Diff expr): not matched

7. analysis_8 (GO): not matched (annotation's analysis_8 has different name)

Thus, matched count is 2 (analysis_1 and analysis_6). Hence, 5 missing (7-2=5). 

Yes, so calculations hold.

Another point: In the analyses' accuracy, the two matched analyses had their analysis_data pointing to incorrect sources. 

For analysis_1 in the annotation: analysis_data is ["data_2"], but their data doesn't have data_2. That's a critical error, so accuracy for that sub-object is 0. 

Analysis_6 in the annotation has analysis_data pointing to analysis_5 (overrepresentation), which in groundtruth's case it should point to analysis_5 (diff expr). Since the dependency is different, this is a discrepancy. Hence, that sub-object's accuracy is also 0. 

Thus total accuracy remains 0.

Final scores as above.
