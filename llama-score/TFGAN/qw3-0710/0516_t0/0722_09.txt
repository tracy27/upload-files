**Scoring Annotation Result Against Groundtruth**

### **Structure (10 points each)**

| **Component** | **Score** | **Deductions & Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data**   | **10/10** | No structural issues detected. |
| **Analyses** | **10/10** | Proper JSON structure maintained. |
| **Results** | **10/10** | Correct structure across all entries. |

### **Content Completeness (40 points each)**

| **Component** | **Score** | **Deductions & Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data**   | **28/40** | - **Missing**: data_4 & data_5 from Groundtruth.<br>- **Extra**: None, but data_3 has more complete info than Groundtruth. |
| **Analyses** | **20/40** | - **Missing**: Analyses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 from Groundtruth.<br>- **Extra & Different**: Analyses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (different names/data/labels). |
| **Results** | **24/40** | - **Missing**: Results for analysis_5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 from Groundtruth.<br>- **Extra & Different**: All results differ significantly in content. |

### **Content Accuracy (50 points each)**

| **Component** | **Score** | **Deductions & Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data**   | **35/50** | - **data_1 & data_2**: Omics type generalized ("Genomics" vs "DNA sequencing", "Transcriptomics" vs "RNA sequencing").<br>- **data_3**: Source added, more specific. |
| **Analyses** | **10/50** | - **Severe Differences**: Analysis names, data associations, and labels do not match Groundtruth. |
| **Results** | **15/50** | - **No Direct Matches**: Metrics, values, and features largely inconsistent with Groundtruth. |
