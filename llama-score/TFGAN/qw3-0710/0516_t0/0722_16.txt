**Scoring Annotation Result against Groundtruth**

### **Groundtruth (GT) vs. Annotation Result (AR)**

#### **Data**

| **Criteria** | **Max Points** | **Score** | **Deductions & Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | 10 | 10 | No issues in JSON structure. |
| **Content Completeness** | 40 | 20 | Missing 4 out of 6 sub-objects (data_4, data_5, data_6, and a modified version of data_2). AR combines some GT data types under broader categories or misses them entirely. |
| **Content Accuracy** | 50 | 30 | - **data_1**: "RNA-seq" → "Transcriptomics" (Semantic Match, No Deduction)<br>- **data_2 (GT)**: Not directly matched in content with AR's data_2 (Epigenomics), treating as missing.<br>- **data_3**: "single-cell RNA-seq data" → Matches in content with AR's data_3 (Minor wording difference, No Deduction)<br>- Deducted for inaccuracies in public_id for data_2 (if considered a match) and missing links/formats in GT but present in AR (not deductible since GT is the reference). |
| **Total** | 100 | **60** |  |

#### **Analyses**

| **Criteria** | **Max Points** | **Score** | **Deductions & Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | 10 | 8 | Extra "label" field in all AR analyses (Not in GT, but doesn't hinder understanding). |
| **Content Completeness** | 40 | 20 | Only 1 out of 7 analyses somewhat matches in scope (Analysis of data_1/data_2 in both, but different names and scopes). Others are completely different or missing. |
| **Content Accuracy** | 50 | 15 | - **analysis_1 (GT)**: No direct match in AR.<br>- **Matching Analysis (by data linkage)**: AR's "Gene co-expression network analysis" uses data_1 & data_2, but the analysis type and details differ significantly from any single GT analysis.<br>- Deducted heavily due to lack of direct semantic matches. |
| **Total** | 100 | **43** |  |

#### **Results**

| **Criteria** | **Max Points** | **Score** | **Deductions & Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | 10 | 10 | No issues. |
| **Content Completeness** | 40 | 0 | Completely different analyses referenced, hence no matching results. |
| **Content Accuracy** | 50 | 0 | No applicable matches to assess accuracy. |
| **Total** | 100 | **10** |  |

### **Final Scores**

    "Data": 60,

    "Results": 10
}
```

### **Detailed Rationale for Scores**

- **Data**:
  - **Structure (10/10)**: Both GT and AR have the correct JSON structure.
  - **Content Completeness (20/40)**: AR misses several specific omics data types present in GT and groups or alters others, leading to a significant deduction.
  - **Content Accuracy (30/50)**: While some data types were semantically matched, the absence of direct matches for others and changes in public_ids (for the interpreted match) led to deductions.

- **Analyses**:
  - **Structure (8/10)**: Deducted for the consistent addition of a "label" field not present in GT.
  - **Content Completeness (20/40)** & **Content Accuracy (15/50)**: Significant deductions due to a lack of direct matches in analysis types, scopes, and linked data between GT and AR.

- **Results**:
  - **Structure (10/10)**: Correct structure.
  - **Content Completeness & Accuracy (0/40 & 0/50)**: No applicable matches to score, given the disparate analyses referenced.
