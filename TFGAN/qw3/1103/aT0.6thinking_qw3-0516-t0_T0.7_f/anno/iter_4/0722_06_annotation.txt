Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to go through the user's query and the provided feedback to understand what needs to be fixed in the JSON extraction. 

Starting with the data section. The user mentioned that data_4 had an incorrect source. The original entry said "blood and plasma samples," but the feedback says it should be "Animal and patient plasma samples." So I'll update that. Also, data_5 was incorrectly labeled as "Epigenomics" instead of "Genomics," but wait, no—the feedback says data_5 is correct as "Epigenomics," but the source was okay. Wait, the user's correction for data_5 was changing the omics type to "Epigenomics," but the original data_5 was already labeled as "Epigenomics." Hmm, maybe the feedback was pointing out that the omics type was correct but the source was okay. Wait, looking back, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect. Wait, the original data_5 was labeled as "Epigenomics," but the feedback says the paper discusses epigenetic modifications, so it's correct. Maybe that was a typo in the feedback? Wait, no, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect. Wait, no, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's feedback under data_5 says: "The paper does not explicitly refer to 'blood and plasma samples' as the source for metabolomics data. Instead, metabolomics studies in the paper refer to animal and patient plasma samples..." Wait, no, data_5 is about epigenomics. Wait, the original data_5 was labeled as "Epigenomics" with source "Blood and post-mortem neural tissue." The feedback says the omics type is incorrect. Wait, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect. Wait, no, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was correct as "Epigenomics," but the source was okay. Wait, the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect. Wait, looking back:

Original data_5 was:
{"id": "data_5", "omics": "Epigenomics", ...}

But the feedback says: "data_5: ❌ Incorrect source: The paper discusses epigenetic modifications using blood and post-mortem neural tissue, which is correct, but this omics type is not explicitly categorized as "Epigenomics." ✅ Correction: Change the omics type to "Epigenomics", as the paper discusses DNA methylation, histone modifications, and other epigenetic mechanisms."

Wait, that's confusing. The user's feedback says the omics type was incorrect but then says to change it to Epigenomics. Wait, perhaps the original entry was correct. The user's feedback says that data_5's omics type was incorrectly labeled, but the correction is to keep it as Epigenomics. So maybe the original entry was correct, but the feedback was pointing out that the source was okay. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the feedback. Alternatively, perhaps the original data_5 was labeled as Genomics, and the feedback corrects it to Epigenomics. Wait, looking at the original data section, data_5 is indeed labeled as "Epigenomics," so the feedback might have been a mistake. But the user's feedback says data_5's omics type was incorrect, but the correction is to change it to Epigenomics. That seems contradictory. Maybe the original data_5 was labeled as something else. Wait, looking back at the original Annotation Result:

Original data_5 was:
{"id": "data_5", "omics": "Epigenomics", "link": "", "format": "", "source": "Blood and post-mortem neural tissue", "public_id": ""}

So the omics was already "Epigenomics," which matches the feedback's correction. Therefore, the feedback might have had a typo. So no change is needed for data_5's omics type. The feedback might have mistakenly mentioned it was incorrect. So proceed as is.

Next, data_4's source was changed from "blood and plasma samples" to "Animal and patient plasma samples" based on the feedback.

Moving to analyses: analysis_4 and analysis_5 were labeled as Metabolomics and Epigenomics, which is correct. The feedback says they should be kept as standalone if applicable, but the user's original had them as separate analyses, which is fine.

Now, results section: several metrics were incorrect. For example, analysis_1's metric was "Presence/Absence," but the feedback says it should be "Mutation Status." Similarly, analysis_3's metric was "Sensitivity/Specificity," but the feedback suggests "Abundance." Apply these changes.

Also, for data_4, the source was corrected to "Animal and patient plasma samples," and for data_5, the source remains "Blood and post-mortem neural tissue" with omics type "Epigenomics."

Putting it all together, adjust the metrics in the results and correct the sources where necessary. Ensure that all other fields that were correct remain as they are, and only apply the necessary corrections based on the feedback.
