The revised annotation has been corrected to address the following issues:

### Improvements Made:
1. **Analyses Section:**
   - Added proper `label` fields for transcriptomics and integrative multi-omics analyses (`{"group": ["SALS1", "SALS2"]}`).
   - Ensured the `analyses` section reflects the correct input data types for each analysis.

2. **Results Section:**
   - Corrected `metric` fields to match the actual biological metrics mentioned in the paper:
     - Transcriptomics → Fold Change
     - Proteomics → Sensitivity/Specificity
     - Metabolomics → Sensitivity/Specificity
     - Epigenomics → Fold Change
     - miRNomics → Sensitivity/Specificity
     - Integrative Multi-Omics → Integrated Biomarker Panel
   - Added missing features like `TDP-43`, `Poly(GP) proteins`, and specific miRNAs to the `features` lists.
   - Removed incorrect entries such as "SALS1" and "SALS2" from the `features` list in the transcriptomics result (they belong in the `label` field).

3. **General Consistency:**
   - Ensured that all features in the results align with the specific biological entities discussed in the paper (e.g., proteins, miRNAs, metabolites).
   - Verified that the `metric` and `features` for each analysis are logically paired with the context of the paper.

These changes now reflect the true biological and methodological intent of the original article and align with the extraction rules. **No further edits are needed.**
