**Feedback on Annotation Accuracy and Completeness:**

---

### ✅ **Accurate and Complete Aspects**
- **Data Extraction**:  
  - `data_1` and `data_2` correctly represent the proteomic and transcriptomic datasets used in the study.
  - New `data_3` (clinical metadata) is appropriately added to capture patient cohort data for the case-control analysis.

- **Analyses**:  
  - Most analyses (`analysis_1`–`analysis_8`) accurately reflect the computational methods described in the paper, particularly for integrating multi-omics data and constructing diagnostic models.

- **Results**:  
  - Results for `analysis_1`, `analysis_2`, `analysis_4`, and `analysis_6` are well-extracted with relevant metrics and features.
  - The addition of multiple AUC results for `analysis_7` and `analysis_8` captures the nuanced reporting in the paper.

### ⚠️ **Inaccuracies, Omissions, and Improvements Needed**

#### 1. **Missing Data Object for Multi-Omics Integration**  
   - **Issue**: The integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data (as shown in Figure 1E) is a core aspect of the study, yet `data_1` and `data_2` are treated separately in the analysis inputs.  
   - **Fix**: Add a merged data object (e.g., `data_4`) representing the combined proteomic and transcriptomic dataset, especially since it forms the basis for the tumour-derived biomarker identification.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "data_4",
       "omics": "Integrative proteotranscriptomics",
       "link": "null",
       "format": "null",
       "source": "Integrated analysis of data_1 and data_2",
       "public_id": "null"
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Incomplete Analysis for Age-Based Stratification**  
   - **Issue**: The age threshold (47 years) is derived from ROC and RCS analyses but is not explicitly modeled as a standalone analysis. Instead, it appears as a result within `analysis_6`.  
   - **Fix**: Create a dedicated analysis (`analysis_9`) to model the age cutoff determination.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "analysis_9",
       "analysis_type": "Threshold determination",
       "analysis_data": ["data_3"],
       "training_set": [],
       "test_set": [],
       "label": {"age_group": ["<47", "≥47"]}
     }
     ```
     - Include this in `analysis_8`'s dependencies and results.

#### 3. **Missing Analysis for Inter-Tumoral Heterogeneity**  
   - **Issue**: The paper reports heterogeneity in IgM expression among EMZLs (Figures 1G, 2A, and S6A–C). However, the corresponding differential expression analysis is missing from the annotation.  
   - **Fix**: Add a new analysis (`analysis_10`) for the IgM-high vs. IgM-low subgroup comparison.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "analysis_10",
       "analysis_type": "Subgroup differential expression",
       "analysis_data": ["data_2"],
       "training_set": [],
       "test_set": [],
       "label": {"IgM_level": ["high", "low"]}
     }
     ```
     - Link to the results in `analysis_3` (e.g., gene sets related to GPCR and WNT signaling).

#### 4. **Insufficient Detail in Features for `analysis_3`**  
   - **Issue**: The features listed in `analysis_3` are generic ("activated GPCR signaling pathway") and lack the specificity of the genesets mentioned in the paper (e.g., interleukin 10-related gene set).  
   - **Fix**: Use exact gene set names from the paper (e.g., "Wnt signaling pathway", "IL10 signaling pathway") to align with the methods section.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "features": ["Wnt signaling pathway", "Interleukin 10 signaling pathway", "GPCR signaling pathway"]
     }
     ```

#### 5. **Missing Results for Calibration Plots in Nomogram**  
   - **Issue**: While the calibration plots (Figures 4D–E) are mentioned in the paper, they are not explicitly captured in the results.  
   - **Fix**: Add a result entry to `analysis_8` to describe the calibration performance.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "analysis_id": "analysis_8",
       "metric": "Calibration agreement",
       "value": "Strong agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes",
       "features": []
     }
     ```

#### 6. **Ambiguity in `analysis_7` Training/Test Sets**  
   - **Issue**: The ROC analysis (`analysis_7`) is performed on data split via PSM, but the training/test set structure is unclear.  
   - **Fix**: Clarify that the test set corresponds to the validation cohort (as implied in Figure 3D–E and 4B–E).  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "test_set": ["data_3_validation_cohort"]
     }
     ```

#### 7. **Missing Analysis for Diffusion-Weighted MRI**  
   - **Issue**: The paper suggests combining the preEM model with MRI for diagnostic completeness, but this is not modeled in the analyses.  
   - **Fix**: Add a new analysis (`analysis_11`) for the combined diagnostic approach.  
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "analysis_11",
       "analysis_type": "Diagnostic model integration",
       "analysis_data": ["analysis_8", "MRI_data"],
       "training_set": [],
       "test_set": [],
       "label": {"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}
     }
     ```
     - Note: `MRI_data` would require additional data object creation if available.

### ✅ **Final Verdict**  
While the annotation is mostly accurate and complete, key aspects of the methodology (e.g., subgroup analysis, threshold determination, MRI integration) are missing or underrepresented. Addressing the above issues will improve alignment with the paper’s content and enhance reproducibility.

**Action Required:** Apply the suggested fixes before finalizing the annotation.
