The revised annotation result addresses the feedback as follows:

1. **Analysis 4**: The label for SNPs now explicitly states their functional contexts as described in the paper, including their association with gene regulation (e.g., "ARID5B promoter, RUNX3 binding disruption") and proximity to apoptosis-related genes (e.g., "BCL2L11 enhancer").

2. **Analysis 8**: The label was updated to generalize the focus of the enrichment analysis ("drug_response_genes") instead of listing specific drugs. The specific drugs (e.g., Imatinib, Etoposide) were moved to the `features` field in the corresponding result entry, aligning with the paper's emphasis on drug-response gene enrichment rather than specific examples in the label.

3. **Minor formatting adjustments**: Ensured JSON validity and consistency with the provided schema.

**No further edits needed**.
