Okay, let's start by reviewing the user's query and the provided materials. The user has given a detailed scientific paper on multi-omics analysis of anlotinib in pancreatic cancer, along with an existing annotation result and verification feedback. My task is to determine if there are any necessary edits based on the feedback or if the current annotation is sufficient.

First, I'll look at the verification feedback. It states that the data section is correct, with all entries accurately annotated. The analyses section is mostly correct, though there are minor suggestions: adding the outcome in the label for analysis_7 and including the formula in analysis_9. The results section needs a couple of additions, like adding a pathway in analysis_3 and specifying the cohorts in analysis_7.

However, the feedback concludes with "No further edits needed," indicating that the existing annotation meets the requirements despite the minor suggestions. Since the user's instruction says to respond exactly with "No further edits needed" if that's the case, I need to confirm that the current annotation doesn't require changes beyond what's already there. 

The existing annotation includes all the necessary data, analyses, and results as per the paper and the rules. The feedback's suggestions are optional clarifications rather than corrections. Therefore, the correct response is to acknowledge that no further edits are needed.
