**Feedback on Annotation Result**

### **Content Completeness and Accuracy Assessment**

#### ✅ **Correct Entries**
- The annotation captures the majority of key data, analyses, and results from the article, including:
  - Properly structured `data` entries with links to relevant datasets (e.g., GSE120575, GSE78220).
  - Accurate identification of immune cell clusters and their association with ICT outcomes.
  - Clear mapping of differential analyses (e.g., cluster 12, 21, 22).
  - Validation of the `ImmuneCells.Sig` signature across multiple datasets.

#### ⚠️ **Required Edits**

##### 1. **Issue in `analysis_3`**
- **Problem**: 
  - The `label` field is vague and does not clearly define the comparison being made.
  - The `value` field uses a descriptive string instead of a numeric value (e.g., p-value or enrichment score).
  
- **Suggestion**:
  - Refine the `label` to specify the comparison (e.g., "TREM2hi macrophages vs. other macrophage subtypes").
  - Use a numeric value (e.g., a p-value or normalized enrichment score) to align with standard reporting conventions for pathway analysis.

##### 2. **Formatting Inconsistencies in `analysis_5` and `analysis_6`**
- **Problem**:
  - The `value` fields in some entries combine the metric with dataset identifiers (e.g., `"0.96 (GSE91061)"`) — this conflates metric values with contextual labels.
  
- **Suggestion**:
  - Remove dataset identifiers from the `value` field and keep it strictly numerical.
  - Add dataset-specific context to the `features` field or an optional `metadata` field if required (not currently defined in the schema).

### **Final Note**
Overall, the annotation is **highly accurate** and captures the scientific intent of the study. Only minor adjustments to **label clarity** and **value formatting** are required for full compliance with the annotation rules and clarity. 

**No further edits needed** except for the suggested corrections above.
