The annotation result has been revised to address the feedback regarding content completeness and accuracy based on the article. Key revisions include:

1. **Merged PCA Analyses**: Consolidated three redundant PCA analyses (metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics) into a single analysis (`analysis_11`) with unified metrics and features, reflecting the distinct separation of cEVs and nEVs across multiple omics datasets.

2. **Corrected Feature Usage**: Removed specific gene names (e.g., `DDIT3`, `XBP1`) from the `features` field in `analysis_2` since the article does not explicitly list these genes, and replaced it with a generalized description of "376 overlapping differentially expressed genes."

3. **Removed Non-Biomarker Features**: Removed the `features` field in `analysis_18` as the features previously listed ("DDIT3 siRNA," "scRNA") were experimental conditions, not biomarkers.

4. **Added Specific Thresholds**: Added the exact threshold value for the transcriptomics analysis (`analysis_1`) as described in the article.

5. **Removed Redundant Features**: Removed the `features` field from `analysis_3` as the information was already included in the `value` field.

6. **Ensured Consistency with Article Data**: Verified that all metrics, labels, and data sources align with the article's descriptions, including public identifiers for transcriptomics and proteomics datasets.

These updates ensure the annotation accurately reflects the methodologies and findings described in the article while adhering to the provided annotation rules.
