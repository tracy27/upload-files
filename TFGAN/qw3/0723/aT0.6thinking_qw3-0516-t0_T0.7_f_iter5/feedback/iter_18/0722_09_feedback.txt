The annotation result has been revised to address the feedback. Key improvements include:

1. **Description Expansion**: Added detailed explanations of RCB classes (pCR, RCB-I, RCB-II, RCB-III) in `data_4`, `analysis_1`, and `analysis_7`. Descriptions now clarify the biological relevance of genomic/transcriptomic features (e.g., HRD/APOBEC signatures) and their relationship to treatment outcomes.

2. **Label Clarification**: Added explicit labels for RCB classes (`"RCB class": ["pCR", "RCB-I", "RCB-II", "RCB-III"]`) in `analysis_1`, `analysis_5`, and `analysis_7`.

3. **Feature-Outcome Linkage**: Enhanced descriptions to tie features (e.g., normalized enrichment scores, HLA LOH) to their clinical implications (e.g., immune evasion, treatment resistance).

4. **Metrics Contextualization**: Added context for metrics like binding affinity scores (<500 nM) and normalized enrichment scores (-2 to 2) to align with the article’s findings.

5. **Consistency Checks**: Ensured all labels and descriptions are consistent with the article’s methodologies and results (e.g., `analysis_7` now explicitly states the AUC-ROC of 0.87 from external validation).
