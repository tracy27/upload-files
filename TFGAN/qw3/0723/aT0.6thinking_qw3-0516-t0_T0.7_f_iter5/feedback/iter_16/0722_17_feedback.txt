The annotation result has been revised to address the issues raised in the feedback:

1. **Missing Biomarkers in Features**: 
   - Added `TP53`, `CDK4`, and `CDK1` as features in relevant analyses (`analysis_1`, `analysis_4`, and `analysis_14`) where they were missing despite being mentioned in the article.

2. **Overrepresented Biomarkers**:
   - Removed `CDK4` and `CDK1` from `analysis_3` to address the overrepresentation concern, as they were not central to that analysis.

3. **Mismatch Between Metrics and Features**:
   - Updated `analysis_14` to ensure the metrics and features align correctly by incorporating `TP53`.

4. **Inconsistent Labels and Features**:
   - Adjusted `analysis_14` to include `TP53` as a feature since the label refers to TP53 status.
   - Adjusted `analysis_15` to include `TP53` as a feature since the label refers to TP53 status.

These changes ensure the annotations are now aligned with the content of the article and the feedback requirements.
