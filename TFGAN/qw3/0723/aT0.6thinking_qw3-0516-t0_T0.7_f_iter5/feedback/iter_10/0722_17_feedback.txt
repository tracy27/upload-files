The annotation result has been revised to address the feedback. Key improvements include:

1. **Completeness**: All analyses now include required fields (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`, `label`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`).
2. **Correctness**: Labels were refined to match the article's definitions (e.g., `analysis_4` now uses "Young (<60)" and "Old (≥60)").
3. **Formatting**: Ensured consistency in field names and proper JSON syntax.
4. **Features**: Added missing `features` for all analyses, including relevant biomarkers like `CDK4`, `TP53`, and `HOGA1`.
5. **Public IDs**: Assigned valid public identifiers for relevant data entries.

The updated JSON is now ready for submission.
