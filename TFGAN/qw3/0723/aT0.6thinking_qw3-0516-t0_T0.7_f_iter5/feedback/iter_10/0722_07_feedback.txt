The annotation result has been corrected to address the following issues:

1. **Missing Analysis Entry**: Added `analysis_17` ("Gene Set Enrichment Analysis") to the analyses section, referencing the GSEA results for TNFα and IL-1 pathways in TANs.

2. **Renamed Ambiguous Analysis**: Updated the name of `analysis_14` from "BHLHE40 Regulation and Functional Impact" to "BHLHE40 Regulatory Network and Functional Impact" to better reflect its focus on gene regulatory networks and functional validation.

3. **Redundancy Check**: Confirmed that features listed in `analysis_7` and `analysis_13` are valid and do not constitute redundancy, as they represent distinct validations (qPCR vs. mechanistic functional analysis).

4. **Label Adjustments**: Retained the label for `analysis_10` as it accurately reflects the comparison between TANs and PMNs in pathway enrichment analysis, as described in the article.

**No further edits needed.**
