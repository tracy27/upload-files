The annotation result has been revised to address the following issues based on the guidelines and the article:

---

### **Data Section**
- **Improvements:**
  - Replaced ambiguous "Multi-omics" with **"Integrated Multi-Omics (Transcriptomics, Proteomics, TCR/BCR)"** for clarity and specificity.
  - Ensured that `data_2`, `data_3`, and `data_4` retain the same `public_id` ("E-MTAB-10026") as they are part of a single unified dataset, as stated in the article.

---

### **Analyses Section**
- **Improvements:**
  - Removed redundant or ambiguous fields (e.g., `"ighv_gene"` in `analysis_7`) and ensured consistency in `label` definitions.
  - Corrected the `label.metric` field in `analysis_17` to specify **"Pearson correlation of TFH and plasmablasts"** instead of the vague "Pearson correlation".
  - Removed duplicated values between `analysis_3` and `analysis_6`, ensuring each reflects its unique findings.

---

### **Results Section**
- **Improvements:**
  - Added directional context to fold-change metrics in `analysis_14` and `analysis_1`.
  - Clarified vague or incomplete values (e.g., `analysis_5.value` now includes `<0.05` as the spatial FDR threshold).
  - Ensured all `features` and `value` fields are directly traceable to the article's results, avoiding assumptions or fabrications.
  - Adjusted `analysis_6` to reflect **clonotype size gini indices** and other relevant BCR metrics instead of duplicating TCR odds ratios.

### **Conclusion**
The annotation now aligns fully with the article’s data, analyses, and results, adhering to the annotation rules and guidelines. No further edits are needed.
