The annotation result has been revised to address the feedback. Key changes include:

1. **Analysis 5**: Added `label` specifying the cell lines (`hTERT-HPNE`, `HPDE-H6c7`) analyzed in the GO analysis, as stated in the article.

2. **Analysis 12**: Adjusted the `features` field to match the standard format by listing only the abbreviations (`FGF2`, `GM-CSF`) instead of the full names.

3. **Result 1**: Updated the `metrics` to reflect the intended meaning of the threshold for differential expression, aligning with the value provided in the article.

These adjustments ensure consistency in formatting and accuracy in reflecting the article’s content while adhering to the annotation rules and avoiding fabrication of unmentioned details.
