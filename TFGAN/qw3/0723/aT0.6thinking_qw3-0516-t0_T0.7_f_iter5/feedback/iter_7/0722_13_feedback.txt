The annotation result has been revised to address the following issues:

1. **Label Accuracy**: 
   - In `Analysis_1`, the label was ambiguous (using "cell_type") and has been corrected to use `cell_line` with the exact cell lines mentioned in the article: `"hTERT-HPNE"` and `"HPDE-H6c7"`.

2. **Metric Specificity**:
   - In `Analysis_11`, the metric was too generic ("Distinct separation"). It was refined to `"Distinct separation of cEVs and nEVs"` to reflect the PCA analysis's purpose and findings as described in the article.

3. **Feature Completeness**:
   - In `Analysis_5`, the feature list was missing `"lipid synthesis"`, which was explicitly mentioned in the article's GO analysis of DEGs. This has been added to the features.

4. **Consistency and Validity**:
   - All other changes preserve the structure and content of the annotation while ensuring alignment with the article's findings and the annotation rules. The JSON syntax has been validated and no redundant or inconsistent entries have been introduced.

The rest of the annotation remains unchanged, as the feedback indicated no further critical corrections were needed beyond these adjustments. The revised version maintains fidelity to the article while adhering to the annotation guidelines.
