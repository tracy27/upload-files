The annotation result has been revised to address the feedback. Key changes include:

1. **Inclusion of Key Biomarkers**: Ensured TP53, CDK4, and CDK1 are included in relevant analyses where they are explicitly mentioned in the article.

2. **Removal of Redundant Biomarkers**: Removed CDK4 and CDK1 from analyses where they are not central to the analysis.

3. **Corrected Metrics Alignment**: Adjusted metrics to align with the features used in each analysis, ensuring each metric is relevant to the features specified.

4. **Label and Feature Consistency**: Ensured that labels and features are aligned appropriately, particularly for analyses involving TP53, CDK4, and CDK1.

The revised annotation now correctly reflects the article content and addresses the feedback points raised.
