The annotation result has been revised to address the following issues:

### Improvements Made:

1. **Public ID Consistency for Non-Public Datasets**:
   - Ensured that `data_3` (Lipidomics) and `data_4` (Metabolomics) correctly reflect `"public_id": "Not publicly available"` to maintain alignment with the article's disclosure.

2. **Label Field Completeness**:
   - Added missing `EV_type` labels for `analysis_11` (PCA for Polar Metabolites), aligning with the article's clarification that the analysis distinguishes cEVs and nEVs.
   - Updated `analysis_13` (`PCA for Proteomics`) to include `"EV_type": ["cEV", "nEV"]` to capture the distinction in the article.

3. **Clearer Metrics and Value Definitions**:
   - Replaced ambiguous metrics like `"Protein expression validation"` (in `analysis_15`) with `"Fold change in protein expression"`.
   - Simplified and standardized `"Significant increase in wound closure and cell invasion"` in `analysis_17` to `"Migration and Invasion Index"` for clarity and specificity.

4. **Removed Redundancies and Enhanced Feature Populations**:
   - Populated the previously empty `features` field in `analysis_13` (`PCA for Proteomics`) with key proteins such as `"TSG101", "CD81"` from the article's discussion of dysregulated proteomics data.
   - Added relevant metabolites and lipid species in the `features` of `result_9` (`analysis_10`) and `result_10` (`analysis_11`) to reflect specific biomarkers identified in the article.

### Final Note:
The revised annotation now fully aligns with the article's content and the annotation rules. No further edits are necessary unless additional context arises.
