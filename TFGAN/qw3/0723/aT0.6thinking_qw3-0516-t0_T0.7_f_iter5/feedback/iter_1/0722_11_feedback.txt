**Feedback on Annotation Result**

### **Data Section**
- **data_1**: The annotation appears correct. The omics type ("Proteomics") and the source ("Proteomics Platform...") align with the article. However, the `link` and `format` fields are marked as `"null"`; if no link or format is mentioned in the article, it's acceptable to leave them blank rather than marking them as `"null"`.
  
- **data_2**: The annotation is incomplete. While the omics type is correctly specified as "Transcriptomics," the `source` field is marked as `"null"`. From the article, the source of the transcriptomic data is not explicitly named, but it likely comes from the same cohort as the proteomic data or from the same research institution (possibly the "Proteomics Platform of Core Facility..."). Since the source is not clearly stated in the article, it's acceptable to leave the `source` field blank (`""`) rather than marking it as `"null"`. The `public_id` and `format` remain blank as expected.

### **Analyses Section**
- **analysis_1 (Proteotranscriptomic analysis)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is accurate.
  - The `analysis_data` contains both `data_1` and `data_2`, which is correct since this analysis integrates both proteomic and transcriptomic data.
  - The `label` is correctly `"null"` because the analysis does not involve comparing distinct groups (case vs. control) in the way the rules describe.

- **analysis_2 (Case-control analysis)**:
  - The `analysis_name` and `analysis_data` are correct.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}`. This reflects the distinction made in the case-control analysis described in the article.

- **analysis_3 (Differential expression analysis)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` only includes `data_2` (Transcriptomics), which is appropriate for this type of analysis.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"IgM_level": ["high", "low"]}`, reflecting the subgroup comparison in the differential expression analysis.

- **analysis_4 (Multivariate logistic regression)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` includes `data_1` and `data_2`, which is accurate as the regression uses serum IgM (from proteomic data) and possibly other variables from the transcriptomic data.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated as `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "nonmalignant diseases"]}`, which matches the analysis described in the article.

- **analysis_5 (Propensity score matching)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` includes `data_1`, which is appropriate since PSM is applied to serum IgM (proteomic data).
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}`.

- **analysis_6 (Restricted cubic splines)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` includes `data_1`, which is appropriate.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}`.

- **analysis_7 (ROC analysis)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` includes `data_1`, which is appropriate.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}`.

- **analysis_8 (Nomogram construction)**:
  - The `analysis_name` is correct.
  - The `analysis_data` includes `analysis_5`, `analysis_6`, and `analysis_7`, which is correct since the nomogram is built using the outputs of these analyses.
  - The `label` is correctly annotated with `{"diagnosis": ["EMZL", "controls"]}`.

### **Results Section**
- **result_1 (analysis_1 - Spearman correlation)**:
  - The `metrics`, `value`, and `features` are correct and reflect the analysis described in the article.

- **result_2 (analysis_1 - log2(foldchange))**:
  - This is correct and accurately represents the result from the same analysis.

- **result_3 (analysis_2 - AUC)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are correct, and the `features` correctly mention "IgM."

- **result_4 (analysis_3 - differential expression analysis)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are marked as `"null"`, which is acceptable if no quantitative metrics are provided for the gene set analysis.
  - The `features` are correct and reflect the gene sets identified in the differential expression analysis.

- **result_5 (analysis_4 - multivariate logistic regression)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are correct.
  - The `features` are accurate and reflect the independent predictor identified in the article.

- **result_6 (analysis_5 - PSM and AUC)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are correct.
  - The `features` are accurate and reflect the biomarker used in the analysis.

- **result_7 (analysis_6 - RCS analysis)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are correct.
  - The `features` are accurate.

- **result_8 (analysis_7 - ROC analysis)**:
  - The `metrics` and `value` are correct.
  - The `features` are accurate.

- **result_9 (analysis_8 - Nomogram construction)**:
  - The `metrics` is `"AUC"`, but the `value` is `"null"`. This is acceptable if the article does not explicitly report a numerical AUC for the nomogram. The `features` correctly mention the "preEM score."
