adnexal lymphoma, proteomics
Multi-omics and case-control analyses identify immunoglobulin M as a tumour-derived
in neoplastic cells instead of bystanders (Figure
S1
). The malignant B cells exhibit monotypic immunoglobulin expression with light chain restriction. We developed an "absolute κ/λ score" to quantify monoclonality in multiomics data. The score calculated by transcriptomic and proteomic data were both significantly higher in EMZLs compared with nonmalignant diseases (Figure
S2A,
B
) and significantly correlated in EMZLs (Figure
S2C
). The serum score was highly correlated to the serum IGHM in EMZLs instead of controls (Figure
S2D,
E
). This evidence supports the tumour-derived nature of serum IgM and further attributes the elevated IgM to the neoplastic cells.
We investigated 205 patients with pathologically confirmed diagnoses who underwent serum immunoglobulin examination in a case-control analysis (Table
S4
). Patients with OAL apart from EMZL, lymphoid hyperplasia and chronic orbital inflammation (idiopathic orbital inflammation, IgG4-related disease, Granuloma, Mikulicz disease, Sarcoidosis disease, Kimura disease, Sjögren syndrome and Amyloidosis) were enrolled as controls. Serum IgM was significantly higher in EMZL compared with other subgroups and diagnoses (Figure
2A
and Figure
S3A
). Among immunoglobulins, IgM exhibited a strong diagnostic potential in differentiating EMZLs from controls (Figure
2B
). It also consistently distinguished EMZLs from subgroups and diagnoses (Figure
S3B
). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that serum IgM (p < 0.001) was the independent predictor for EMZL (Table
S5
). Paired IgM concentrations were available in 70 patients at diagnosis and after treatment. OA-EMZL patients exhibited a significantly decreased serum IgM after initial treatment (Figure
2C
). There was no significant correlation between serum IgM and clinicopathological features of EMZL patients (Figure
2D,
F
). The results indicated the consistency of serum IgM in EMZLs.
Furthermore, we evaluated potential confounders based on the previous report.

Different genders exhibited a similar serum IgM concentration in all subgroups   (Figure
S4A
). Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between serum IgM and age in control and chronic inflammation groups (Figure
2D
). Restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis suggested serum IgM as a linear variable (Figure
S4B
), and age as a non-linear variable (p for non-linearity = 0.002) (Figure
S5A
). Thus, we defined an optimal cutoff for age at diagnosis as 47 years based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and converted it into a category variable (Figure
S5B
).
To simplify the usage of serum IgM concentration in the clinical context, we conducted propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize the potential bias and further converted IgM into an ordinal variable (Figure
3A
and Table
S6
). After PSM, serum IgM consistently distinguished EMZLs from controls (Figure
3B
). IgM was fitted consistently as a linear variable (Figure
3C
). The cutoff value of serum IgM concentration at 1.46 g/L (Specificity 0.897; Sensitivity 0.559) was determined by ROC; 0.88 g/L (Specificity 0.560; Sensitivity 0.853) was determined by the minimal Akaike information criterion (AIC) value of RCS (Table
S7
). The ordinal IgM exhibited a comparable area under the curve (AUC) compared with the continuous (Figure
3D,
E
).
Serum IgM solely is not sufficient for the preliminary diagnosis based on its AUC. Thus, we further constructed a diagnostic model. In the validation cohort, multivariate analysis showed IgM between 0.88-1.46 g/L (p = 0.017), IgM ≥1.46 g/L (p < 0.001), and age at diagnosis < 47 (p = 0.008) were independent predictors of EMZL (Table
S8
). Lacrimal gland involvement was included in the equation based on AIC. A nomogram entitled preliminary EMZL diagnostic model (preEM) was constructed based on the results (Figure
4A
). Compared with continuous or ordinal IgM, preEM exhibited relatively higher discriminative ability in both derivation and validation sets (Figure
4B,
C
). The calibration plots exhibited a great agreement between nomogram predictions and actual observations (Figure
4D,
E
).
Previous findings have established the diagnostic application of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for OAL.

Herein, we identified preEM as a practical preoperative diagnostic model for its major subtype, OA-EMZL. The combination of these two might provide a complete diagnostic process for orbital lymphoproliferative diseases and chronic inflammation.
Although EMZLs exhibited a high IgM, the results suggested an intertumoral heterogeneity (Figures
1G
and
2A
). We performed a differential expression analysis based on transcriptomic data between IgM-high and IgM-low EMZLs to investigate potential mechanisms (Figure
S6A
). The result suggested that activated GPCR, WNT and interleukin 10-related genesets were associated with higher IgM (Figure
S6B,
C
). Further study is required to decipher this heterogeneity and the limitation of IgM for diagnosis.
CONCLUSION
Serum IgM is a tumour-derived biomarker used to differentiate OA-EMZL from idiopathic orbital inflammation, IgG4 related disease and orbital lymphoproliferative disorders. The preEM constructed based on ordinal serum
IgM, age at diagnosis, and lacrimal gland involvement is a practical preoperative diagnostic tool for OA-EMZL.
