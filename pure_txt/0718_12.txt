Subtype
Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung cancer. Our purpose was to explore molecular subtypes and core genes for LUAD using multi-omics analysis. Methods: Methylation, transcriptome, copy number variation (CNV), mutations and clinical feature information concerning LUAD were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas Database (TCGA). Molecular subtypes were conducted via the "iClusterPlus" package in R, followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Correlation between iCluster subtypes and immune cells was analyzed. Core genes were screened out by integration of methylation, CNV and gene expression, which were externally validated by independent datasets. Results: Two iCluster subtypes were conducted for LUAD. Patients in imprinting centre 1 (iC1) subtype had a poorer prognosis than those in iC2 subtype. Furthermore, iC2 subtype had a higher level of B cell infiltration than iC1 subtype. Two core genes including CNTN4 and RFTN1 were screened out, both of which had higher expression levels in iC2 subtype than iC1 subtype. There were distinct differences in CNV and methylation of them between two subtypes. After validation, low expression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 predicted poorer clinical outcomes for LUAD patients.
Conclusion:
Our findings comprehensively analyzed genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics of LUAD, offering novel underlying molecular mechanisms for LUAD. Two multi-omics-based core genes (CNTN4 and RFTN1) could become potential therapeutic targets for LUAD.
Background
Lung cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide
[1]
. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and 5-year survival rate is only about 16%
[2]
. LUAD is the most common histological subtype of NSCLC
[3]
. Although great achievements have been made in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of LUAD, it is still one of the most aggressive and fatal types of lung cancer
[4]
. Patients with LUAD are usually diagnosed at advanced stages, who exhibit high resistance to conventional radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Thus, it is of importance to clarify the molecular mechanisms of LUAD.
Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, chromatin organization, histone modification, and regulation of noncoding RNAs, are essential for regulation of gene expression, such as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes
[5]
[6]
[7]
. Dysregulation of epigenetic modifications can lead to the activation or inhibition of multiple signaling pathways
[8,
9]
. Wholegenome studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation modifications are more frequent in human cancer cells than in normal cells
[10,
11]
. Thus, epigenetics can provide epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancers
[12]
. CNV is very common in the human genome, including deletions, insertions, gains as well as multi-site mutations, leading to the progression of various cancers. CNV can contribute to abnormal expression of genes as well as the heterogeneity of the genome and molecular phenotype. DNA CNV is in relation to the high risk of LUAD
[13,
14]
. However, it has not been well developed. Recent research has suggested that the treatment of lung cancer should pay attention to mutations and epigenetic changes at the same time
[15]
. Such as mutations of EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 play an important role in lung tumorigenesis, but not all tumors develop by activation of these mutations alone and are eliminated by suppressing these genes
[16,
17]
. Thus, it is of importance to comprehensively analyze epigenetics, mutations as well as transcriptome by multi-omics.
With the continuous advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology, it has been allowed to synthetically analyze human genome, epigenome, and transcriptome. Each omic study may provide analysis concerning a certain biological function or a molecular layer
[18]
. Thus, multi-omics analysis can reveal synergistic interactions. A subset of genes identified from different omics studies are closely related with biological functions. However, few studies have analyzed the prognosis of LUAD through multi-omics, and a general opinion has not yet been received. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides high-throughput data for a variety of cancers, including LUAD, allowing to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumors
[19]
. In this study, we performed multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics for LUAD, offering novel underlying molecular mechanisms for LUAD.
Methods
LUAD data retrieval
The workflow of this study is shown in Fig.
1
. After integrating RNA-seq data (n = 585), CNV data (n = 532), methylation data (n = 503) and samples with complete clinical information (n = 509) for LUAD in the TCGA database, 440 LUAD samples were used for our study (Fig.
2a
). We obtained 440 samples of HTSeq-FPKM and HTSeq-count transcriptome data from TCGA database via the xenabrowser website (
https://xenabrowser. net/
). Additionally, 450 K methylation data and SNV mutation mutect2 data of TCGA-LUAD were retrieved. Then, "Masked Copy Number Segment" data from TCGA-LUAD were obtained through the Genomic Data Commons (GDC;
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/
) portal. Clinical information of each patient including gender, age, TNM stage (pathologic T, pathologic N, pathologic M), tumor grade, and overall survival (OS) was obtained through the GDC portal, as listed in Table
1
. Also, the data of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment came from the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) website (
https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/ timer/
).
Data preprocessing
The preprocessing of CNV data was as follows: Two regions with 50% overlap were considered identical. We removed regions overlay less than five probes. GSTIC2 software was utilized to calculate the CNV of genes in the Masked Copy Number Segment data using gh38 as reference genome. Multiple CNV regions in a gene were merged into one region, and CNV values were averaged a merged CNV value. As for methylation data, methylation sites that cannot be detected in more than 70% of the samples were deleted, and then the missing values were filled in using the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The following data were removed: methylation data covering SNP sites, methylation sites on sex chromosomes, multi-alignment methylation sites. Then, the methylation sites in the 200 bp upstream and downstream of the gene transcription start site (TSS) were screened for downstream analysis. The preprocessing of transcriptome data was as follows: genes with FPKM values below 0.1 in 50% of the samples were removed.
Identification of CNV and methylation-related genes
The correlation coefficient between the expression level of each gene and CNV or methylation sites in the range of 200 bp upstream and downstream of the gene TSS was calculated and verified by student's t test. P-value< 0.01 was set as the screening standard. The correlation value was converted into the Z-score according to the following formula: ln ((1 + r) / (1-r)). Multiple t testing was then presented.
Correlation analysis of CNV and methylation
CNV data of each sample were classified into three types: loss, normal and gain in line with -0.3 and 0.3. Methylation data were divided into hypomethylation, normal as well as hypermethylation according to 0.2 and 0.8. Correlation between the four types of loss, gain, hypomethylation and hypermethylation was calculated.
Identification of CNVcor genes or METcor genes for LUAD
Genes related to CNV or methylation sites were divided into high-and low-expression groups according to the median value of gene expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was subsequently presented. Genes with p-value< 0.01 were named as CNVcor genes or METcor genes.
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analysis
Clustering analysis of CNVcor genes and METcor genes through k-means algorithm was performed by NMF method
[20]
. The optimal number of clustering was then evaluated. According to the optimal grouping number, all samples were clustered into different subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by log-rank test was used to assess the difference in prognosis between different subgroups
[21]
. Furthermore, the differences in CNVcor NMF and METcor NMF subgroups were compared.
iCluster multi-omics clustering By combining CNVcor genes, METcor genes and gene expression, the iClusterPlus package (version 1.24.0) was used for multi-omics clustering analysis. The optimal clustering was then screened. The differences between iCluster clustering and CNVcor NMF clustering or METcor NMF clustering were evaluated. Moreover, the differences in survival between different iCluster subgroups were compared by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
TIMER analysis
The correlation between gene expression and abundance of immune infiltrates was analyzed by the TIMER algorithm
[22,
23]
. Immune cells were composed of B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.
External validation of core genes by independent datasets
Using the LUAD datasets from the KMPlot website (
https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php
), Kaplan-Meier curves were performed on OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) analysis. Two LUAD expression profiles and corresponding follow-up information were retrieved from the GSE31210 and GSE37745 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/
). Based on the expression cutoff values of core genes, OS analysis was presented between high-and low-expression groups. Furthermore, the expression and prognosis of core genes were validated using the GEPIA database (
http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/
).
Patients and specimens
A total of 20 pairs of LUAD tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from Thoracic Surgery, Cangzhou Central Hospital (Hebei, China). Our study followed the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. This study gained the approval of Ethics Committee of Cangzhou Central Hospital (2018066).
RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from tissues using Trizol reagent (TAKARA, Dalian, China), which was reverse transcribed into cDNA. RT-qPCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT real-time system by SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Shanghai, The distribution map of methylation-related genes on chromosomes. X-axis is different chromosomes, and Y-axis is the distribution ratio of methylation-related genes on each chromosome. e Histogram showing the positions of methylation sites relative to GC islands. X-axis suggests the feature types of methylation sites relative to GC islands, and Y-axis suggests the proportion of methylation sites in each type to all methylation sites. f Percentages of methylation-related genes in each gene type.

X-axis expresses Z-value, and Y-axis expresses the density distribution corresponding to the Z-value China). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Relative expression levels were calculated with the 2 -ΔΔCt method.
Western blot
Total protein was extracted from tissues or cells via RIPA lysis (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), which was separated by SDS-PAGE. Following being transferred onto PVDF membranes, the membranes were blocked by 0.5% skimmed milk and incubated with primary antibodies against CNTN4 (1/1000; ab137107; Abcam, USA), RFTN1 (1/1000; ab233438; Abcam) and GAPDH (ab8245) at 4 °C overnight. Then, they were incubated with secondary antibodies (SA00001-1; Proteintech, Wuhan, China) at room temperature for 2 h. At last, images were acquired and analyzed.
Cell culture and transfection LUAD A549 cells (Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, which were grown at an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 37 °C. LUAD cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/CNTN4 (GenePharma, Shanghai, China), pcDNA3.1/ RFTN1 plasmids (Gene-Pharma) and their corresponding controls through lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). After 48 h, western blot was performed to verify the transfection effects.
Clone formation assay
Transfected cells were inoculated culture dishes (1000 cells/dish). After culture for 14 days, the cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min. The number of clones was counted under an inverted microscope (DM4000B; Leica, Germany).
Wound healing assay
Transfected cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate. When the confluence reached 80%, a 200 μm pipette tip was used to scratch the cells. After treatment for 48 h, the
Transwell assay
Transwell assay was performed to detect the invasion of cells. Matrigel was added to the upper chamber and incubated for 1 h. The cells were seeded onto the upper chamber (1 × 10 3 /well). Meanwhile, 600 μl complete medium was added to in the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells were fixed by paraformaldehyde and stained by crystal violet. The images were observed under an inverted microscope (DM4000B; Leica, Germany).
Statistical analysis
R language and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used for statistical analysis. The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. The difference between two groups was analyzed by student's t-test, while multiple comparisons were presented by one-way analysis of variance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Identification of CNV and methylation-related genes for LUAD
For each gene, the pearson correlation between CNV and gene expression was calculated and verified by student's t test. P-value< 0.01 as the screening criterion, a total of 11,171 CNV-related genes were identified for LUAD (Supplementary Table
1
). The top ten CNVrelated genes were listed in Table
2
. The distribution of genes significantly related to CNV on the chromosomes was shown in Fig.
2b
. Also, box plots showed the distribution of correlation coefficients between gene expression levels and CNVs on different chromosomes (Fig.
2c
). After multiple t testing, we found that correlation coefficients in chromosome 2, chromosome 19 and chromosome X were significantly lower than other chromosomes. We then calculated the pearson correlation between the methylation sites in the 200 bp upstream and downstream of the TSS and the expression level for each gene. A total of 18,609 methylation sites and 6867 corresponding genes had distinct correlations (Supplementary Table
2
). The top ten genes positively and negatively related to methylation were separately listed in Table
3
. Figure
2d
depicted the distribution of methylation-related genes on different chromosomes.
We compared the positions of these methylation sites relative to GC island types (Fig.
2e
). In Fig.
2f
, most of methylation sites belonged to island type. As expected, most of them were classified into protein-coding genes. Figure
2g
visualized the distribution of the Z-value of correlation coefficients between CNV or methylation and gene expression.
Correlation between CNV and methylation in LUAD
CNV included loss, normal and gain three types, while methylation was composed of hypomethylation, normal and hypermethylation for each LUAD sample. We calculated the correlation between the four types (loss, gain, hypomethylation and hypermethylation). In Fig.
3a
, CNV gain was significantly correlated with CNV loss among 440 LUAD samples (r = 0.32, p = 2e-11). A positive correlation between CNV gain and hypermethylation was found, as shown in Fig.
3b
(r = 0.14, p = 0.0049). Also, CNV gain was in association with hypomethylation (Fig.
3c
; r = 0.26, p = 7.8e-08). There was a positive association between CNV loss and hypermethylation (Fig.
3d
; r = 0.14, p = 0.0045). Moreover, CNV loss had a positive relationship with hypomethylation (Fig.
3e
; r = 0.21, p = 1.1e-05). In Fig.
3f
, hypermethylation was negatively correlated with hypomethylation (r = -0.18, p = 0.00011).
Identification of CNVcor and METcor genes for LUAD
A total of 360 CNV-related genes and 239 methylationrelated genes were significantly related with survival of patients with LUAD according to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, which were respectively defined as CNVcor genes and METcor genes. The Venn diagram showed 140 CNVcor and METcor genes for LUAD (Fig.
4a
). CNVcor genes were analyzed by NMF cluster analysis. The optimal number of grouping was identified when starting with cophenetic getting smaller. As shown in Fig.
4b
, the optimal cluster number was selected as 2.
In consistent clustering results of NMF grouping results, it was appropriate to divide into two subgroups including CNVcorC1 and CNVcorC2 (Fig.
4c
). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results suggested that LUAD patients in CNVcorC1 usually had a poorer prognosis than those in CNVcorC2 (Fig.
4d
). At the same time, we chose the optimal cluster number as 2 for METcor genes by NMF cluster analysis (Fig.
4e,
f
). Compared to METcorC2 group, it was predicted that patients in METcorC1 had a worse clinical outcome (Fig.
4g
). Then, we compared the difference between CNVcorC1 and CNVcorC2. As depicted in Fig.
4h
, there were distinct differences for most of samples between CNVcorC1 and CNVcorC2 subgroups.
Construction of two iCluster molecular subtypes for LUAD
Based on these CNVcor genes, METcor genes, and gene expression profile, two iCluster molecular subtypes were conducted using multi-omics analysis. The difference in copy number of CNVcor genes between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype was compared. As depicted in the heat maps, iC2 subtype had more frequent loss and gain of CNVcor genes than iC1 subtype (Fig.
5a
). We also compared iCluster and CNVcor NMF clustering results based on LUAD samples. In Fig.
5b
, there was an obvious difference between two clustering results. Figure
5c
showed the distribution of methylation sites of METcor genes between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype. A significant difference between iCluster and METcor NMF clustering results was found in LUAD samples (Fig.
5d
). LUAD patients in iC1 subtype often showed a poorer prognosis than those in the iC2 subtype (Fig.
5e
). Heat maps showed that there was a notable difference in expression pattern of the top 100 genes between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype (Fig.
6a
). Furthermore, we separately displayed the distribution of CNV (Fig.
6b
) and methylation (Fig.
6c
) of the top 100 genes between the two subtypes. In Table
4
, we found that there were significant differences in age, status, pathologic N, and tumor stage between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype for LUAD. In Fig.
7a
, we visualized the differences in abundance of six immune cells between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype for LUAD. We found that, B infiltrating cell content in iC2 subtype had significantly higher expression levels than those in iC1 subtype (Fig.
7b
). However, there was no statistical significance in abundance of macrophages (Fig.
7c
), CD4+ T cells (Fig.
7d
), CD8+ T cells (Fig.
7e
), neutrophils (Fig.
7f
) and dendritic cells (Fig.
7g
) between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype.
Identification of two core genes for LUAD
Through integration of gene expression, methylation and CNV data, two multi-omics-based core genes were identified, including CNTN4 and RFTN1 (Fig.
8a
). In Fig.
8b
, CNTN4 loss accounted for distinctly higher proportion than its gain both in iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype. CNTN4 expression was notably higher in iC2 subtype than that in iC1 subtype (Fig.
8c
). Furthermore, more frequent hypermethylation of CNTN4 was found in iC2 subtype (Fig.
8d
). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results suggested that low CNTN4 expression indicated a worse clinical outcome for LUAD patients (Fig.
8e
). In Fig.
8f
, RFTN1 had more frequent gene loss both in iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype. Moreover, it had a higher expression level in iC2 subtype than in iC1 subtype (Fig.
8g
). As shown in Fig.
8h
, only hypomethylation of RFTN1 was detected in two subtypes. Furthermore, the ratio of RFTN1 hypomethylation was higher in iC2 subtype than in iC1 subtype. Low RFTN1 expression significantly predicted a poorer prognosis of patients with LUAD (Fig.
8i
).
Prognostic values of two core genes for LUAD
In the LUAD dataset from the KMplot database, low CNTN4 expression notably predicted poorer OS (Fig.
9a
; HR = 0.74 (0.57-0.97), p = 0.031) and PFS (Fig.
9b
; HR = 0.57 (0.48-0.68), p = 4.7e-11) for LUAD patients. However, its expression was not significantly associated with DSS of patients with LUAD (Fig.
9c
; HR = 0.87 (0.56-1.33), p = 0.51). For RFTN1, we found that patients with low RFTN1 expression usually exhibited shorter OS (Fig.
9d
; HR = 0.64 (0.53-0.78), p = 5.1e-06), PFS (Fig.
9e
; HR = 0.61 (0.54-0.70), p = 3.4e-14) and DSS (Fig.
9f
; HR = 0.75 (0.58-0.96), p = 0.025) time. Following validation using the GEPIA database, CNTN4 (Fig.
9g
) and RFTN1 (Fig.
9h
) were both down-regulated in LUAD samples than in normal samples. As shown in spearson correlation analysis, there was a positive correlation between CNTN4 and RFTN1 in LUAD and normal samples (Fig.
9i
; R = 0.59, p = 1.8e-78).
iC1 subtype had more frequent single nucleotide variants (SNVs) than iC1 subtype for LUAD
The differences in SNV site mutations between iC1 subtype and iC2 subtype were carried out using the Fisher test. Genes with p-value< 0.01 were screened out. Heat maps showed that iC1 subtype had more frequent SNVs compared to iC1 subtype for LUAD samples (Fig.
10
). As for the two core genes, we analyzed the correlations between CNTN4 and RFTN1 gene expression and SNV locus. Table
5
and Table
6
listed the top ten most significant correlations between CNTN4 and RFTN1 gene expression and SNVs.
External validation of prognostic value and expression for CNTN4 and RFTN1 in LUAD
Two independent datasets were used for validation of prognostic value for CNTN4 and RFTN1 in LUAD patients. LUAD patients were separately divided into highand low-expression groups according to the cutoff values of CNTN4 and RFTN1. Both in the GSE31210 and GSE37745 datasets, patients with low CNTN4 (Fig.
11a,
b
) or RFTN1 (Fig.
11c,
d
) significantly indicated a poorer prognosis than those with their high expression. We further validated the expression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 in 20 pairs of LUAD samples and adjacent normal tissues using RT-qPCR. The results showed that CNTN4 and RFTN1 were significantly lowly expressed in LUAD tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (Fig.
11e,
f
).
CNTN4 and RFTN1 are lowly expressed in LUAD and their overexpression inhibits LUAD cell proliferation
Our western blot results confirmed that CNTN4 (Fig.
12a,
b
) and RFTN1 (Fig.
12a,
c
) were both upregulated in LUAD than normal tissues. To investigate their biological functions in LUAD, CNTN4 (Fig.
12d,
e
) and RFTN1 (Fig.
12f,
g
) was distinctly overexpressed in LUAD cells. Compare to controls, overexpression of CNTN4 (Fig.
12h,
i
) and RFTN1 (Fig.
12h,
j
) significantly inhibited the proliferation of LUAD cells.
Overexpression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 inhibits migration and invasion of LUAD cells
Wound healing assay was used to examine the migration of LUAD cells after overexpression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 (Fig.
13a,
b
). Our data suggested that the migrated ability was suppressed by overexpression CNTN4 and RFTN1 (Fig.
13c,
d
). Furthermore, we assessed the invasive capacity of LUAD cells transfected with overexpression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 via transwell assay (Fig.
13e,
f
). The results showed that invasion of LUAD cells was inhibited following transfection with overexpression of CNTN4 and RFTN1 (Fig.
13g,
h
).
Discussion
In this study, we constructed two prognosis-related molecular subtypes for LUAD based on multi-omics analysis of transcriptome, CNV and methylation. LUAD patients in iC1 showed poorer prognosis. Furthermore, two core genes including CNTN4 and RFTN1 were identified, which could participate in the progression of LUAD. Gene CNVs including DNA gain and loss may be considered as crucial therapeutic targets, which are closely related to tumor resistance and malignant biological behaviors
[24]
. Moreover, determination of the methylation driver genes can offer a basis for the prognosis prediction and personalized targeted therapy for LUAD
[25]
. In our study, we identified a total of 360 CNVrelated genes and 239 methylation-related genes that were significantly related with LUAD patients' prognosis. Using NMF cluster analysis, we conducted two CNVcor subtypes (CNVcorC1 and CNVcorC2) and two METcor subtypes (METcorC1 and METcorC2). Both CNVcor and METcor subtypes can distinctly predict LUAD patients' prognosis.
Two iCluster molecular subtypes were constructed for LUAD by multi-omics analysis. LUAD patients in iC1 could show a poorer prognosis than those in iC2 subtype. Furthermore, there were distinct differences in age,
[26,
27]
. It is of great significance to research the differential expression of immune-related genes in LUAD tissue samples for understanding the immune microenvironment of LUAD, which could provide new insights into patients' prognosis
[28]
. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between the iCluster multiomics gene sets and immune cells of LUAD. iC2 subtype had a higher level of B cell infiltration than iC1 subtype for LUAD.
A comprehensive analysis comparing the top-ranked genes from different omics studies may not find many overlapping genes. In this study, two core genes were identified including CNTN4 and RFTN1. There were remarkable differences in gene expression, CNV and methylation of the two genes between iC1 and iC2 subtypes. In recent years, many studies have shown that gene expression can predict the survival of LUAD patients, thereby assisting in the decisionmaking of chemotherapy
[29]
. Our results suggested that low CNTN4 and RFTN1 expression predicted a poorer prognosis for patients with LUAD. The SNV frequency of genes in the iC1 was significantly higher than that in the iC2, indicating that these mutated genes can be used as prognostic biomarkers for this molecular subtype. The two core genes had highly frequent SNVs in LUAD samples. As previous studies, CNTN4 SNV has been found to be associated with several diseases. For example, rs9849237 (CNTN4) CC genotype is related to an increased risk of oral cancer in an Indian cohort

. Additionally, RFTN1 SNP (rs690037) could be related to primary open-angle glaucoma
[32]
. After validation, CNTN4 and RFTN1 were both lowly expressed in LUAD compared to controls at the mRNA and protein levels. Their overexpression significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells, suggesting that they could be involved in the progression of LUAD.
In this study, we constructed two molecular subtypes and identified two core genes for LUAD, which offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of LUAD. However, in-depth clinical and basic experiments should be required to further validate our findings.
Conclusion
Taken together, we performed multi-omics analysis of transcriptome, CNV and methylation for LUAD. CNV and methylation may play key roles in LUAD progression. Two omics subtypes were constructed, which possessed important clinical significance. Moreover, two omics-based core genes were identified and their overexpression inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells, which could become promising therapeutic targets for LUAD.
