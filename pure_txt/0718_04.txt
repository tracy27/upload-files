transcriptome
Objectives: Several animal disease models have been used to understand the mechanisms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the translation of findings from animals to humans has not been sufficiently examined in drug development. To confirm the validity of New Zealand black x New Zealand white (NZB/W) F1 mice as an SLE model, we extensively characterized SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice by omics analysis. Methods: Peripheral blood from patients and mice and spleen and lymph node tissue from mice were analysed using cell subset analysis, cytokine panel assays, and transcriptome analysis. Results: CD4 + effector memory T cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells were increased in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon gamma induced protein-10, and B cell activating factor in plasma were significantly higher in SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice than in their corresponding controls. Transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of genes involved in the interferon signalling pathway and T-cell exhaustion signalling pathway in both SLE patients and the mouse model. In contrast, death receptor signalling genes showed changes in the opposite direction between patients and mice. Conclusion: NZB/W F1 mice are a generally suitable model of SLE for analysing the pathophysiology and treatment response of T/B cells and monocytes/macrophages and their secreted cytokines.
Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with heterogeneity and divergence of severity. Its pathophysiology is characterized by a failure of self-tolerance, B-cell hyperactivity, autoantibody production, aberrant formation of immune complexes, and dysfunction of multiple organs, including the kidneys
[1]
. While numerous drug discovery studies and clinical trials have been conducted for SLE, several drug candidates have failed
[2,
3]
despite showing good efficacy in SLE animal models
[4]
[5]
[6]
.
The 'lupus-prone' New Zealand black x New Zealand white (NZB/W) F1 hybrid strain is often used as a representative and established SLE animal model, which exhibits several symptoms and pathology similar to human SLE, such as kidney failure, interferon signature, and anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibody production
[7]
. Therefore, this strain has contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmunity, which has also enabled researchers to evaluate the efficacy of new drug candidates.
In a recent case, an anti-B cell activating factor (BAFF) antibody was shown to ameliorate SLE phenotypes in NZB/W F1 mice
[8]
, and later studies confirmed the clinical efficacy of a BAFF inhibitor for SLE
[9,
10]
. In contrast, the clinical efficacy of an anti-CD20 antibody was limited in SLE patients
[2,
3]
despite showing clear improvements in NZB/W F1 mice
[4]
[5]
[6]
. Thus, findings obtained in drug development for SLE in animals do not always translate to humans because of the discrepancy in immune system differences between humans and mice
[11]
. A more precise understanding of SLE in humans and murine models should increase the success rate of drug discovery.
Recent studies have conducted comprehensive omics analysis of SLE using human clinical samples
[12]
. Pathogenic genes and pathways were indicated with isolated T cell or B cell in previous reports
[13]
[14]
[15]
. Furthermore, omics approaches have been used on rodent SLE models to explore key molecules and pathways for translation to humans by comparison with human data
[16,
17]
.
To elucidate the validity and limitation of a mouse model of SLE, we aimed to confirm the validity of the NZB/W F1 mouse strain as an SLE model by comparing data from peripheral blood (PB) from humans [healthy controls (HCs) and SLE patients] and PB and lymphoid tissues from mice (C57BL/6 and NZB/W F1). We analysed the transcriptome using multi-omics techniques, transcriptome with microarray or ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq, cell subset analysis using flow cytometry (FCM), and peripheral cytokines using a panel assay system and extensively compared human SLE and the murine model.
Materials and methods
Human blood sample preparation
The study protocol (G520 and G771) was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine. We recruited patients with SLE and healthy volunteers. All patients had been diagnosed and treated at Kyoto University Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
We collected PB from 29 patients with SLE and 16 healthy volunteers. For the preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and separation of plasma, 40 ml of PB was collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-treated tubes or heparinized tubes. PBMCs were prepared using Lymphocyte Separation Solution (density = 1.077, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and used for cell subset analysis using FCM or isolation of T cells, B cells, and monocytes. Plasma separated by centrifugation was aliquoted and stored at -80 ∘ C.
Animal experiments
NZB/W F1 female mice and C57BL/6 female mice were purchased from Nihon SLC, Japan, and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Committee on Animal Research of Kyoto University, Faculty of Medicine. Mice were sacrificed by full blood collection under isoflurane anaesthetization at age 36-38 weeks to obtain PB, spleen (SPL), lymph nodes (LNs), and kidneys. Urine was collected just before sacrifice. Unless stated otherwise, NZB/W F1 mice (n = 4, where n refers to a pooled sample from five mice; the total number of mice used was 20) and C57BL/6 mice (n = 3, where n refers to a pooled sample from four mice; the total number of mice used was 12) were used for each experiment. Anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin G (IgG) in pooled plasma was measured using a mouse anti-dsDNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (FUJI-FILM Wako Shibayagi, Japan). Protein and creatinine in urine from individual mice were determined using a Quick start protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and CRE kit (Kainos, Japan), respectively. Histopathological evaluation of kidneys was conducted at Sapporo General Pathology Laboratory (Sapporo, Japan). Kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with methenamine silver-periodic acid-Schiff and scored for disease severity from 0 to 6 according to kidney morphology based on the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification of lupus nephritis
[18]
.
Cell subset analysis and cell isolation by multicoloured FCM Humans PB cells from SLE patients and healthy volunteers were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against individual markers, as shown in Supplementary Table
S1
. All samples were suspended in FCM buffer and analysed using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Fortessa Analyzer, BD Bioscience). CD3 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and monocytes were purified from PBMCs using immune magnetic beads: Dynabeads M-450 CD3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), RosetteSep Human B Cell Enrichment Cocktail (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), and Dynabeads M-450 CD14 (Invitrogen), respectively. Briefly, PBMCs were diluted with separation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM EDTA) and mixed with an isolation agent. After incubation for 20 minutes, tubes containing the mixture were placed onto a magnet for 5 minutes, and isolated cells were collected. Isolated cells were stained with allophycocyaninconjugated anti-mice IgG antibody, and the purity was examined using FCM. Cell isolation was performed at 4 ∘ C.
Mice
Samples were blocked on the Fc receptors with anti-CD16/32 antibody (Clone: 93, BioLegend) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against individual markers, as shown in Supplementary Table
S1
. All samples were suspended in FCM buffer and analysed using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Fortessa Analyzer). CD3 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and monocytes/macrophages for messenger ribonucleic acid sequencing (mRNA-seq) were isolated using a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience) into a sufficient amount of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 at 4 ∘ C. F4/80-PE/Cy7 (Clone: BM8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was used to sort monocytes/macrophages.
All FCM data were analysed using FlowJo software version 10 (TreeStar, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Gates for each cell subset are shown in Supplementary Figure
S1
. Isolated cells for RNA extraction were dissolved in Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Germany) with a reducing agent (3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Japan) and stored at -80 ∘ C.
Multiple cytokine assay
Cytokine levels in plasma were determined using a Procarta immunoassay kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for human samples and a ProcartaPlex Multiplex Panel kit (Affymetrix) for mouse samples according to the manufacturers' instructions.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from CD3 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and monocytes/macrophages from humans and mice using an RNAqueous Micro Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Ambion, USA) with an RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). To confirm the quality of the RNA sample, the RNA Integrity Number was measured using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA samples with RNA Integrity Number ≥7.0 were used for further experiments.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray for human samples
Total RNA (6 ng) from a human sample was amplified using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies) and labelled with Cy3 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression profiling was conducted using Agilent-012097 Human 1A (V2) microarrays G4110B (Agilent Technologies). Gene expression pixel intensities were extracted by scanning the microarrays with an Agilent Scanner (Agilent Technologies). Data from two SLE patients (SLE-152 and SLE-159) were excluded from the analysis because of out-of-data quality check. Data processing and trimming were performed using GeneSpring ver. 12.6.1. Microarray data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number GSE148601.
mRNA sequencing of mouse samples
Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) synthesis and amplification were performed using the SMARTer Ultra low RNA kit for Illumina Sequencing (Takara/Clontech, Japan). Amplified cDNA (input amount: 5-500 ng) was then fragmented and converted into sequencing libraries following the Illumina construction protocol for low-input DNA. Barcoded cDNA libraries were sequenced using the rapid mode (2 × 150 bp paired-end reads) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. In gene expression analysis with sequence data, adaptor-trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10, RefFlat-Genes-mm10-18 November 2014.gtf) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner-MEM in the Genedata Profiler software (Genedata, Switzerland). Sequencing data are available at the public DNA Data Bank of Japan database under the accession numbers DRA010165, DRA010166, DRA010167, DRA010168, and DRA010169.
Transcriptome analysis
Differentially expressed genes between SLE patients and control subjects (P-value by Student's t-test < .01) or between NZB/W F1 mice and C57BL/6 mice (P-value by Student's t-test < .01) for T cells, B cells, or macrophages/monocytes from each tissue were extracted. Next, we extracted genes that were commonly upregulated or downregulated in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice using BaseSpace ® (Illumina, San Diego, CA). For genes with |fold change (FC)| >1.2 in SLE patients, pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ® (Qiagen). In pathway analysis, the number of genes that can be entered was limited. In the case of P < .05, the number of genes to be stored in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ® was too large and overflowed, that is why we used P < .01 as threshold. Regarding FC criteria, since it was unclear to what extent the FC criteria reflected the pathology, we refrained from increasing the exclusion criteria. However, if the |FC| criteria were too small (<1.2), we judged it to be a gene with no variation in expression level and used it as exclusion criteria.
Statistical analysis
Student's t-test was used to compare two groups in GraphPad Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad Software Inc., USA). Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric comparisons in GraphPad Prism. A correlation analysis was conducted using JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Patient profiles and mouse phenotypes
In total, plasma and PBMCs from 29 SLE patients and 16 HCs were analysed in the present study. Since the number of samples used in each assay is different, we have summarized the number of samples in Supplementary Table
S2
, and the profiles of SLE patients and HCs examined in each assay are given in Supplementary Table
S3
. The SLE-like phenotype of 36-38-week-old NZB/W F1 mice was confirmed based on the presence of proteinuria and serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and renal histopathology findings (Supplementary Figure
S2
).
Commonly increased T/B-cell subsets in patients and mice
The proportions of T and B cells among PBMCs and the proportion of each T/B-cell subset among total T/B cells were compared between SLE patients and HCs using FCM (Table
1
and Supplementary Table
S4
). The percentage of CD8 + T cells, CD4 + effector memory T cells, pre-switched memory B cells, post-switched memory B cells, and plasmablasts was significantly higher in SLE patients than in HCs. Next, the proportion of T/B cells in PB, SPL, and LN and the proportion of each T/B subset among total T/B cells were compared between NZB/W F1 and C57BL/6 mice. The percentage of CD4 + T cells, CD4 + effector memory T cells, CD8 + effector memory T cells, germinal centre B cells, and plasmablasts in SPL was significantly higher in NZB/W F1 than in C57BL/6. CD4 + effector memory T cells and plasmablast subsets were significantly increased in both SLE patients (PB) and NZB/W F1 mice (SPL). Unlike SLE patients, the percentage of CD8 + T cells was significantly decreased in NZB/W F1 compared to C57BL/6; however, its absolute cell number was not changed (Supplementary Figure
S3
). When CD4 + T cell was significantly increased in NZB/W F1, it affected the percentage of CD8 + T cell.
Commonly elevated plasma cytokines in patients and mice
In SLE patients, plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, MIP-1α, MIG/CXCL9, M-colony-stimulating factor (CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon gamma induced protein (IP)-10, interleukin (IL)-9, IL-8, IL-31, IL-3, IL-29, IL-1RA, IL-1a, IL-17F, IL-12 (p40 and p70), IL-10, interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-α2, GM-CSF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-β, eotaxin, and BAFF were significantly higher than in HCs (Supplementary Table
S5A
). In NZB/W F1 mice, TNF-α, IP-10, and BAFF were significantly higher than in C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Table
S5B
). TNF-α, IP-10, and BAFF were also higher in SLE patients than in HCs (Figure
1
). IFN-α, one of the most important cytokines in SLE, did not show a significant difference in NZB/W F1 mice (Supplementary Table
S5B
), probably due to the small number of groups. We stratified the patient group into high systemic lupus erythemaosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) group (≥6) and low SLEDAI group (<6) and compared the data of the cytokine panel assay. We found that the levels of IP-10, IL-12p40, and IL-16 were higher in the high SLEDAI group than in the low SLEDAI group (Supplementary Figure
S4
).   A correlation analysis was performed for plasma cytokine levels in SLE patients (Figure
2
, Supplementary Figure
S5
as the enlarged version). Serum anti-dsDNA antibody and the percentage of T/B-cell subsets were also included in the analysis. Most cytokines correlated with each other. IL-12 (p40), IP-10, and IL-16 were significantly correlated with anti-dsDNA antibody titre (Pearson's r = 0.852, 0.7354, and 0.7274, respectively). Among T/B subsets, only percentages of effector and central memory CD8 + T cells were in the same cluster including IL-12 (p40), IP-10, MIG, IL-16, and anti-dsDNA antibody. The percentage of effector memory CD8 + T cells was moderately correlated with IP-10, MIG, IFN-γ, and MIP-1b levels (r = 0.6988, 0.6941, 0.5614, and 0.5517, respectively).
Commonly regulated genes in patients and mice
Using DNA microarray analysis, we conducted a comprehensive search for genes that were significantly differentially expressed, either higher or lower, in PB T/B cells/monocytes from SLE patients compared to HCs. To extract significantly changed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we first set the threshold of the P-value (<.01) and then selected that of the FC (>1.2) to obtain the appropriate data size. Using RNA-seq, we also searched for genes that were significantly differentially expressed, either higher or lower, in PB, SPL, and LN T/B cells/monocytes/macrophages from NZB/W F1 mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. Next, we selected genes that were regulated in the same direction in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice (S1 data file) and performed Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (P < .01, |FC|> 1.2) to obtain lists of commonly expressed pathways (S2 data file). Among these pathways, those found to be common in all analyses comparing human PB with mouse PB, SPN, and LN are shown in Supplementary Table
S6
. The pathways are concisely listed in Table
2
. The interferon signalling pathway was present in both T cells and B cells. Some cytokine-Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-related pathways, the T-cell exhaustion pathway in T cells, and the IL-4 signalling pathway in B cells were also present. IL-12 signalling and some IL-17/Th17-related pathways were present in monocytes/ macrophages. The correlation analysis was performed using the genes involved in the respective common pathways (Supplementary Table
S6
) in T cells (Figure
3
(a), Supplementary Figure
S6A
as the enlarged version), B cells (Figure
3
(b), Supplementary Figure
S6B
as the enlarged version), and monocytes/macrophages (Figure
3
(c), Supplementary Figure
S6C
as the enlarged version). The purpose of this analysis is to find genes that correlate with anti-dsDNA antibodies, a typical clinical indicator of SLE, and cytokines that are commonly increased in humans and mice. Anti-dsDNA antibody and primary plasma cytokines (BAFF, IP-10, and TNFα) were also included in the analysis. We found large clusters containing interferon signature genes such as MX1, IFITM1-3, and IFI35 in the analysis of B cells and T cells. In T cells, interferon-related genes, plasma IP-10, lymphocyte activation gene (LAG)-3 gene, and IL-21 gene were included in the cluster that included anti-dsDNA antibody. In B cells, interferon-related genes, and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 gene were included in the cluster that included anti-dsDNA antibody. In monocytes/macrophages, IL-10 gene and TNFSF13B (BAFF) gene were included in the cluster that included anti-dsDNA antibody.
Oppositely regulated genes in patients and mice
Furthermore, we analysed genes that move in opposite directions in SLE and NZB/W F1. Briefly, among the DEGs that could be measured in both SLE patients (control: healthy subjects) and NZB/W F1 mice (control: C57BL/6 mice), we listed genes that were elevated in SLE patients but decreased in NZB/W F1 mice or decreased in SLE but elevated in NZB/W F1 (S3 data file). Next, we performed pathway analysis on the genes that move in the opposite direction (S4 data file, Supplementary Table
S7
as a summary). We searched for pathways with positive Z-scores in one group and negative Z-scores in another group. Death receptor signalling genes moved in opposite directions in patients and mice (B cell of mouse SPL and T cell of mouse PBMC, Supplementary Table
S8
). Apoptosis signalling, TNFR2 signalling, and lymphotoxin β receptor signalling also moved in opposite directions in the B cells of the patients and the mice. These pathway genes included RelA, RelB, XIAP, and TRAF2.
Genes of interest in recent SLE studies
Recent studies have reported several interesting molecules associated with the pathogenesis of SLE. Those genes were analysed using our dataset and compared between humans and mice. Among them, LAG-3, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element modulator (CREM), and Regnase-1 (ZC3H12A) moved in the same direction in human and mouse T cells in PB (Supplementary Table
S9
).
Discussion
In the present study, we extensively compared human SLE and NZB/W F1 mice by multi-omics analysis and identified similarities in T/B-cell subsets, cytokine profiles in plasma, and RNA expression in T cells, B cells, and macrophages/monocytes.
We found that several cytokines were increased in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice. Previous reports have demonstrated the involvement of various cytokines in human SLE and NZB/W F1 mice
[19]
[20]
[21]
. We found that TNF-α, IP-10, and BAFF were increased in both SLE patients and the mouse model. BAFF is clearly a key molecule in the pathophysiology of SLE in both humans and mice, given that anti-BAFF antibodies have been reported to be effective in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice
[9,
10,
19]
. TNF-α is a typical inflammatory cytokine, which can potentially play an important role in SLE. Although the efficacy of anti-TNF-α antibodies in SLE is controversial
[22]
, there is no inconsistency when considering that type I interferon, which is more an important factor in SLE, becomes relatively dominant by the use of anti-TNF-α
[23]
. IP-10 and several other cytokines, including IL-12 (p40) and IL-16, were more strongly correlated with anti-dsDNA antibody than other cytokines. The role of IP-10 in SLE has been explored using CXCR3 knockout NZB/W F1 mice
[24]
, and the role of IL-12 (p40) has also been examined
[25]
. Therefore, these cytokines may also be potential targets for SLE therapy. Type I interferons are important factors in SLE, with anifrolumab, an anti-type I interferon receptor subunit 1 antibody, shown to significantly improve SLE in clinical settings
[26]
. In our study, levels of IFN-α2 and IFN-β in plasma were significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls, which is consistent with their clinical importance. The involvement of the interferon signalling pathway was also observed in the transcriptome analysis in NZB/W F1 compared to control mice. Furthermore, IFN-α kinoid-vaccine treatment has been shown to delay or prevent lupus manifestations, including proteinuria, histological renal lesions, and death
[27]
, supporting the theory that type I interferons are also involved SLE in the mouse model.
We found that several T/B-cell subsets were increased in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice. There was an increase in the percentage of CD4 + effector memory T cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells in the PB of both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice, which implies aggressive activation of T/B-related immune reaction in both species in common. In addition, the significant increase of germinal centre B cells in the LN and SPL of NZB/W F1 mice suggests that germinal centre formation and autoantibody production were enhanced in these mice. BAFF is thought to be an important factor in B cell differentiation and germinal centre formation, consequently facilitating anti-dsDNA antibody production
[19]
. TNF-α is reported to be produced by CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells
[20]
. The percentage of effector memory CD8 + T cells correlated with IP-10, MIG, IFN-γ, and MIP-1b levels, which is consistent with reports that CD8 + T cells produce IFN-γ, and it consequently stimulates tissue-resident cells to produce IP-10 and MIG
[21]
. CD8 + T cell in PB was increased but not CD4 + T cell in stable SLE patients
[28]
, and a similar result was shown in this study. It may also be caused by glucocorticoids, which are known to reduce the proportion of subsets of CD4 + T cells and increase that of CD8 + T cells
[29]
. We consider this unlikely, however, because we found no significant differences in the percentage of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells between steroid-treated and steroid-untreated patients (Supplementary Figure
S7
). Meanwhile, the percentage of CD8 + T cell was significantly decreased in NZB/W F1 compared to C57BL/6 without reducing its absolute cell number, which was due to the large increase of CD4+ T cells in NZB/W F1. In NZB/W F1 mice, CD4 + T cell has been reported to be involved in the pathophysiology of NZB/W F1 mice
[30]
, which is consistent with the findings of this study.
Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that interferon signature genes were commonly enhanced in both SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice in multiple cell types (T cells, B cells, and monocytes/macrophages) and multiple mouse organs (SPL, LN, and PB). In the present study, T-cell exhaustion pathway and JAK-STAT pathway in T cells and IL-4 signalling pathway in B cells were shared between SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice. The correlation analysis of gene expression in PB from SLE patients showed that LAG-3, a marker of T-cell exhaustion
[31]
, and IL-21, a key contributor to germinal centre formation secreted by follicular T cells
[32]
, were included in the cluster that included anti-dsDNA antibody, IP-10 in blood, and genes in the interferon signalling pathway (Figure
3
(a)). BCL-6 was also included in the similar cluster in B cells (Figure
3(b)
). In macrophages/monocytes, IL-12 signalling and some IL-17/Th17-related pathways were common between SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice, which is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that IL-12 and IL-17 are involved in SLE pathophysiology in humans and mice
[25,
33,
34]
. In our data, plasma IL-12 and IL-17 were not elevated in NZB/W F1. However, their pathways were noted in transcriptome analysis, suggesting the importance of those cytokines in SLE. The correlation analysis of gene expression in macrophages/monocytes showed that IL-10 belonged to a cluster where TNFSF13B (BAFF) gene and anti-dsDNA belonged (Figure
3
(c)). Although IL-10 usually inhibits the production of IL-12 and IL-17
[35,
36]
, it can also stimulate the humoral immune response depending on several factors
[37]
.
Death receptor signalling was upregulated in SLE patients and downregulated in NZB/W F1 mice. It implies that cell death is triggered in lymphocytes of SLE patients, but survival is triggered in NZB/W F1 lymphocytes. The present study suggested that not only NZB/W F1 is suitable as a model for SLE, but also there was a limitation as a model.
LAG-3, CREM, and Regnase-1 are reported as molecules of interest in recent research on SLE and those moved in the same direction in T cell of PBMC between humans and mice in the dataset in the present study. It has been reported that CD25 + cells expressing LAG-3 have the ability to produce IL-17 and show a positive correlation with SLE Disease Activity Index
[38]
. CREM plays an important role in the adaptive immune process through binding to cAMP-response elements during T-cell activation and Th17 differentiation
[39]
. Regnase-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators by gating the degradation and/or translational silencing of target mRNAs of IL-6 and TNF-α, and its deficiency causes SLE-like phenotypes
[40]
. Any novel genes of interest about SLE can be searched using this dataset because it has been presented on the internet.
The results of transcriptome analysis must be interpreted carefully because an identical gene may have different roles in mice and humans. For example, pathway analysis of B cells in our data suggested the involvement of IL-7 signalling in SLE (Table
2
). However, in previous reports, IL-7R deficiency in humans has been found to affect T-cell differentiation but not B-cell differentiation
[41]
. On the other hand, in mice, IL-7R deficiency affected the differentiation of both T and B cells
[42]
.
In conclusion, this study confirmed the presence of several commonalities between SLE patients and NZB/W F1 mice: (1) several lymphocyte subsets, such as CD4 + memory T cells, were commonly increased; (2) BAFF, IP-10, and TNF-α were commonly increased; (3) transcriptome analysis revealed that genes belonging to interferon signalling pathway and the T-cell exhaustion signalling pathway were commonly upregulated although death receptor signalling genes showed changes in the opposite direction; and (4) cluster analysis revealed that IP-10, BAFF, IL-21, and IL-10 were included in the cluster that included interferon signature genes and anti-dsDNA antibody. Based on these findings, NZB/W F1 mice were considered generally suitable as a model of SLE for analysing pathophysiology or treatment response of memory T cells, mature B cells, and monocytes/macrophages and their secreted cytokines although cautions are needed since several points are not common between NZB/W F1 and SLE.

Figure 2. The correlation analysis of plasma cytokine levels, cell subsets, and anti-dsDNA antibody titre in SLE patients. (a) Correlations among cytokine level, anti-dsDNA antibody titre (framed red), and T/B-cell subset (framed green) were analysed. The right bar shows the gradation of colour range for |r | < 1 by Pearson's correlation analysis. The enlarged version is shown in Supplementary Figure S5. (b) Notable cytokines and T/B subsets in the cluster including anti-dsDNA antibody. *IL-12 (p40), IP-10, and IL-16 correlated with anti-dsDNA antibody titre. #Percentage of effector memory CD8 + T cells was moderately correlated with IP-10, MIG, IFN-γ, and MIP-1b.

Anti-dsDNA antibody titre (framed red) and primary plasma cytokines (framed cyan) were also included in the analysis. The bars show the gradation of colour range for |r | < 1 by Pearson's correlation analysis. The enlarged version is shown in Supplementary Figure S7. (d) Notable genes in the cluster including anti-dsDNA antibody. *Interferon signature genes such as MX1, IFITM1-3, and IFI35 serum anti-dsDNA antibody and plasma IP-10 were in the same cluster. #LAG-3 gene and IL-21 gene were also included. $BCL-6 gene was in the interferon-related cluster. §IL-10 gene and TNFSF13B (BAFF) gene were included in the gene group, to which anti-dsDNA antibody belonged to.
