GROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents
Myeloid/natural killer (NK) cell precursor acute leukemia (MNKPL) has been described on the basis of its unique immunophenotype and clinical phenotype. However, there is no consensus on the characteristics for identifying this disease type because of its rarity and lack of defined distinctive molecular characteristics. In this study, multiomics analysis revealed that MNKPL is distinct from acute myeloid leukemia, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and NOTCH1 and RUNX3 activation and BCL11B downregulation are hallmarks of MNKPL. Although NK cells have been classically considered to be lymphoid lineage-derived, the results of our single-cell analysis using MNKPL cells suggest that NK cells and myeloid cells share common progenitor cells. Treatment outcomes for MNKPL are unsatisfactory, even when hematopoietic cell transplantation is performed. Multiomics analysis and in vitro drug sensitivity assays revealed increased sensitivity to L-asparaginase and reduced levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), supporting the clinically observed effectiveness of L-asparaginase.
INTRODUCTION
Myeloid/natural killer (NK) cell precursor acute leukemia (MNKPL) was first proposed to be a leukemia subtype by Suzuki et al.
(1)
in 1997. MNKPL is prevalent in East Asia, similar to other NK neoplasms
(2)
(3)
(4)
. MNKPL is characterized by cells with an immature lymphoblastoid morphology with neither myeloperoxidase (MPO) reactivity nor azurophilic granules. Extramedullary involvement is one of the hallmarks of MNKPL. The immunological phenotype of MNKPL is CD56 + /CD7 + /CD33 + /CD34 + /CD16 -/ CD15 -/+ /HLA-DR + . MNKPL differs from myeloid/NK cell acute leukemia (MNKL)
(5)
, which is characterized by MPO expression and the presence of azurophilic granules. The MNKL immunological phenotype is CD56 + /CD34 -/CD33 + /CD16 -/HLA-DR -
(6)
. Moreover, MNKPL and MNKL differ profoundly from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive NK cell lymphoma/leukemia in terms of EBV negativity. The 2016 revision of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia World Health Organization (WHO) classifications does not mention MNKPL. Therefore, MNKPL would be placed in the WHO classification mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), rare types category
(7)
. Because of the lack of MPO expression and the CD33 + /CD56 + /CD7 + /CD34 + immunological phenotype, some patients with MNKPL who do not have extramedullary involvement may be diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) French-American-British (FAB) classification M0 [AML not otherwise specified (NOS) in the WHO 2016 classification]. Through a large-scale analysis focused on FAB M0, Suzuki et al.
(8)
concluded that despite some exceptions, most CD7 + CD56 + AML FAB M0 cases can be classified as MNKPL. MNKPL genetic characterization has not been performed to date, which may have led to improper MNKPL classification.
In general, the cellular origin during hematopoiesis is important for understanding the characteristics of leukemia, yet no studies have investigated NK cell-derived leukemia while focusing on the early NK cell development process. NK cells have traditionally been considered to be derived exclusively from lymphoid cells. In the early stage of lymphoid cell differentiation, the T cell-determining factor BCL11B forces progenitors toward the T cell lineage, whereas differentiation is committed toward the NK cell lineage in the absence of BCL11B
(9,
10)
. A myeloid-based lymphoid cell development model has been proposed
(11)
in which multilymphoid progenitor cells differentiate into myeloid cells, B cells, or NK cells
(12)
. Myeloid lineage cells can also differentiate into NK cells
(13,
14)
. Several transcription factors (TFs) are involved in NK cell differentiation. For example, Runx3 is highly expressed in NK cells, and loss of Runx3 expression impairs interleukin-15 (IL-15)dependent accumulation of mature NK cells in vivo
(15)
. Elucidation of the molecules involved in MNKPL development, particularly in cells with both myeloid and NK cell differentiation potential, may provide important clues for elucidating the process of NK cell differentiation.
Because of the rarity of MNKPL, consolidation of disease characteristics to define this specific disease type has not been achieved. Furthermore, comprehensive cell biological and genomic analyses necessary to identify the biological features of MNKPL have not been performed. Here, we report comprehensive clinical and genomic features and single-cell analyses showing the origin of leukemia cells in patients with MNKPL to consolidate disease descriptions from a molecular biological perspective and identify therapeutic targets.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Through the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (JSPHO) survey, 22 children or adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (<39 years old) were identified as acute leukemia patients with cell surface expression of myeloid and NK cell markers. Among these patients, 10 children or AYAs were diagnosed with MNKPL based on the immunological phenotype shown in table
S1
. Five cases of MNKPL were not identified through this JSPHO survey but were identified through a literature review, and the corresponding patients were also recruited to participate in this study (see Materials and Methods). Data for a total of 15 patients were obtained from the JSPHO survey and a literature review. The median age of the patients with MNKPL was 13 (0.5 to 75). In the MNKPL group, 10 participants were males and 5 were females (table
S2
).
Genomic landscape of MNKPL
For a total of 13 tumors, the genomic landscape was determined using various methods, including whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 12 of those 13, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 6 of those 13, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 6 of those 13 (fig.
S1A
). A median of 62 somatic mutations in exon and splicing regions were identified by WES with tumor/germline pair analysis. We identified recurrent mutations, including in NOTCH1 (n = 7); ETV6 and KMT2D (n = 5), PIK3C2A, FLT3, and SAMD9L (n = 4); MAML3, MAP3K4, ABL1, CREBBP, SETBP1, KMT2C and MDC1 (n = 3); and NRAS (n = 2) (Fig.
1A
and tables S3 to S5). Of the patients, gene mutations involving the NOTCH pathway were detected in 54% of patients (fig.
S1B
), those involving the RASmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were detected in 31% of patients, and those involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway were detected in 46% of patients (fig.
S2A
). In MNKPL cases with NOTCH1 mutations, NOTCH1 mutation was a primary genetic event (86%) (fig.
S1C
). In most cases, NOTCH1 mutations are located upstream of sequential gene alterations (fig.
S1, C
and
D
). Through WGS, two cases were found to carry ETV6-associated translocation, ETV6:: C3orf62 or ETV6::MAML3; loss of the entire ETV6 gene was observed in one case. In total, five ETV6 alterations (38%), including one frameshift and one nonsense mutation, were identified (Fig.
1
, A to C, and tables S3 to S5). Next, we characterized the mutation profiles based on clinical phenotypes. As extramedullary involvement is a hallmark of MNKPL, differences in gene alteration were compared between samples with and without extramedullary involvement. The mutation frequencies of RAS-MAPK signaling genes, including double alterations (combination of RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway gene alterations), were 43 and 17% in the cases with and without extramedullary involvement, respectively (fig.
S2, B
and
C
). We analyzed the mutation profiles in cases of children (≤18 years old) and adults (>18 years old). The mutation frequency of NOTCH1 was comparable between children and adults (56% versus 50%). However, the mutation frequency of ETV6 was 33% in children and 50% in adults, RAS-MAPK pathway genes were 22% in children and 50% in adults, and PI3K-AKT pathway genes were 33% in children and 75% in adults, respectively.
Distinct genomic profile of MNKPL based on RNA expression, DNA methylation, and SNF analysis
MNKPL is very rare; therefore, the subject population was limited to 13 individuals only. Samples of frozen fresh cells from six of these patients were available for omics analysis. The median age of these six patients was 16.5 (13 to 75) years old (table
S2
). Then, to investigate the expression profile of MNKPL, we performed RNA-seq using the six samples of frozen fresh cells. The RNA expression profiles of these MNKPL samples were then subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis (PCA) 1 Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. 2 Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. 3 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. 4 Leukemia/Lymphoma Committee of Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo, Japan. 5 Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima, Japan. 6 Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan. 7 Research Core, Institute of Research, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. 8 Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. 9 Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. 10 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan . 11 Department of Pediatrics, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan. 12 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. 13 Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan. 14 Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan. 15 Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. 16 Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan. 17 Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. 18 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan. 19 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan. 20 Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan. 21 Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan. 22 Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kindai University, Osakasayama, Japan. 23 Department of Pediatrics, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan. 24 Department of Pediatrics, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan. 25 Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan. 26 Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan. 27 Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. 28 Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan. 29 Department of Pediatrics, Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan. 30 Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Ohtsu, Japan. 31 Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Kyorin University, Tokyo, Japan. 32 Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. 33 Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. 34 Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan. 35 Pediatric Medical Center, Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital, Matsuyama, Japan. 36 Laboratory for Human Disease Models, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan. 37 Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. 38 Data Science and Faculty Affairs, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. *Corresponding author. Email: m.takagi.ped@tmd.ac.jp for comparison of AML, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and MPAL samples from public datasets (see Materials and Methods). As expected, MNKPL was classified independently of AML, T-ALL, and MPAL (Fig.
1D
, fig.
S3A
, and table S6, A to D). Furthermore, genes involved in signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases-e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling, RAS signaling, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathwaywere up-regulated in MNKPL compared to AML and T-ALL according to pathway analysis. In comparison with T-MPAL and B-MPAL, the mTOR signaling pathway was up-regulated in MNKPL. Some of these findings were associated with the genomic landscape of MNKPL, as mentioned above (fig.
S3
, B to E). Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a CD56-positive leukemia in which cells exhibit an immature blastoid morphology. Although CD34 expression is negative in BPDCN, MNKPL and BPDCN are similar in terms of CD56 expression and morphology. The MNKPL expression profile was compared with that of BPDCN and confirmed that the two groups were distinct (fig.
S3F
). In addition, a DNA methylation array was used to identify the DNA methylation profile and validate the expression status in seven MNKPL samples. On the basis of DNA methylation profiling of MNKPL compared with that of AML, T-ALL, and MPAL by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, MNKPL clustered independently of AML and T-ALL. However, the cluster that included MNKPL also included a subset of MPAL (fig.
S3G
). To more accurately cluster these two groups, we performed integrated clustering using similarity network fusion (SNF) analysis on RNA expression and DNA methylation data and found that MNKPL clustered independently of MPAL (Fig.
1E
and fig.
S4
).
NK cell profiles in MNKPL
To clarify the counterpart of MNKPL during hematopoiesis, molecules involved in NK cell differentiation were investigated. The gene expression of crucial TFs involved in hematopoietic lineage commitment, including NK cell differentiation, was evaluated (Fig.
2A
and table
S7
). In addition to the high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations in MNKPL, the expression of NOTCH1 was similar to or negligibly higher than that in T-ALL and much higher than that in AML or MPAL (Fig.
2B
). High NOTCH1 expression was observed in five patients with or without NOTCH1 mutations. Therefore, 9 of 13 patients (69%) in the recruited cohort and 6 of 6 patients (100%) in the RNA-seq cohort displayed NOTCH1 alteration or higher NOTCH1 gene expression than AML patients (fig.
S1A
). Notably, MNKPL was also characterized by higher RUNX3 expression and lower BCL11B expression (Fig.
2B
). RUNX3 gain was observed in one case (Fig.
1A
and table
S5
). RUNX3 regulates IL-15-dependent NK cell activation, and up-regulated RUNX3 expression has been observed in samples from nasal-type extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma patients
(16)
. BCL11B is a crucial TF for T cell development (
9
), and T cell development from common T and NK cell progenitors is determined according to BCL11B expression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the gene set of the NOTCH signaling pathway and the publicly deposited gene set of immature T cell to NK cell differentiation under BCL11B-knockout conditions showed enrichment of these genes in MNKPL (fig.
S5, A
and
B
). To better understand why RUNX3 expression is high and BCL11B expression is low, the methylation status of their promoters and superenhancer regions was investigated. A distinct methylation profile-specifically, hypomethylation of RUNX3 promoter regions (P1 and P2)
(17)
in MNKPL compared with AML, T-ALL, and MPAL and hypermethylation of the BCL11B promoter in MNKPL compared with T-ALL-was identified (Fig.
2, C
and
D
). Enhancer RNA expression of the RUNX3 superenhancer region
(17)
was detected in MNKPL but not in T-ALL, AML, or MPAL (Fig.
2E
). In contrast, expression of ThymoD (18), a long noncoding RNA of the BCL11B superenhancer region, was observed in T-ALL but not in MNKPL, AML, or MPAL (Fig.
2F
). The gene set of NK cell activation that includes genes associated with NK cell proliferation (IL15, IL18R1, IL21R, etc.) was enriched in MNKPL (fig.
S6A
). Although the gene expression of TFs involved in immature NK cell development (SPI1, RUNX3, NOTCH1, and NFIL3) was high, that of TFs involved in mature NK cell differentiation (PRDM1, EOMES, IKZF3, TBX21, and TXNIP) was not high in MNKPL samples (fig.
S6B
)
(19,
20)
.
RUNX3 overexpression induces NK cell commitment
Considering the MNKPL genomic landscape and transcriptome profile, we determined that an enriched NK cell signature, increased RUNX3 expression, NOTCH signaling pathway activation, and lower BCL11B expression are hallmarks of MNKPL. Then, we assessed whether RUNX3 overexpression and NOTCH signaling activation under low BCL11B expression induce NK cell differentiation using an undifferentiated leukemia cell line. KG-1 cells were suitable for the NK cell differentiation assay because of myeloid differentiation potential, undifferentiated cell phenotypes including the positivity for CD34 and NOTCH1, and the lack of BCL11B expression (fig.
S7, A
and
B
)
(21,
22)
. These cells were infected with FLAG-tagged wild-type RUNX3 to overexpress RUNX3 and cultured on OP9-DLL1 cells that express the NOTCH ligand DLL1 (Fig.
3A
and fig.
S7C
). RUNX3 expression and NOTCH signaling activation induced CD56 expression in KG-1 cells (Fig.
3, B
and
C
). The effect of RUNX3 overexpression on KG1 was also investigated under various conditions. The experiment revealed that although RUNX3 overexpression is sufficient for CD56 expression, stimulation of NOTCH1 signaling enhanced CD56 expression, and NK cell differentiation depends on IL-15 and high-dose IL-2 treatment (Fig.
3, B
and
C
; and fig.
S7, D
and
E
).
ETV6-associated genomic alterations
Among 13 analyzed MNKPL subjects, 5 were identified with various mutations, including 2 with ETV6-associated translocation and 1 with deletion of the entire ETV6 gene (Fig.
1, B
and
C
). Thus, the transcriptome analysis data were reevaluated separately for ETV6 wild-type (n = 3) and ETV6-mutant (n = 3) MNKPL samples. The ETV6-mutant subgroup had a more pronounced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene signature (Fig.
4A
and fig.
S8A
), with higher expression of HOXA9 and HOXA10-AS (Fig.
4B
and table
S8
). Next, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. Because of the limited number of available samples, we selected two samples as representative of MNKPL. To provide insight into the effect of ETV6 alteration, ETV6 wild-type and mutatedtype samples were used. The ETV6 wild-type and ETV6-mutated MNKPL patients were 13 years old and 15 years old, respectively (table
S2
). To analyze the cell differentiation machinery using pseudotime analysis, one control [bone marrow (BM) derived from a 12year-old healthy donor] was also subjected to scRNA-seq. scRNAseq using ETV6 wild type and mutated type revealed 3 distinct subsets and 11 subsets, respectively (Fig.
4C
and
table S9
). Overall, the expression of ETV6 was higher in ETV6 wild-type MNKPL (Fig.
4D
). The expression of genes in HSCs and the multipotent progenitor (MPP) signature was much higher in the ETV6mutant MNKPL sample, whereas the expression of NCAM1 (CD56) and genes associated with myeloid cell features (MPO) and involving the neutrophil-myeloid progenitor signature was much higher in the ETV6 wild-type MNKPL sample [Fig.
4 (E
and
F
) and fig.
S8
(B to D)]. These findings suggest that ETV6 mutation potentiates the acquisition of an HSC/MPP-like transcription profile in leukemia cells and that an ETV6 wild-type status potentiates the acquisition of a more differentiated hematopoietic cell transcription profile in leukemia cells.
We next compared subsets showing the highest expression of the HSC/MPP signature in ETV6 wild-type and ETV6-mutant samples. The stem cell subset of the ETV6-mutant sample showed high expression of molecules associated with the AP1 pathway (fig.
S9,
A
to C, and table
S10
). However, the stem cell subset in the ETV6 wildtype sample displayed higher expression of genes expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells (fig.
S9
, D to F, and table
S10
).
To validate the findings of the scRNA-seq data, we reanalyzed the bulk RNA-seq data of ETV6 wild-type and ETV6-mutant MNKPL samples. The expression of gene sets involved in myeloid and lymphocyte differentiation and the NCAM1 (CD56) interaction was up-regulated in ETV6 wild-type samples, indicating that ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cells were more highly differentiated than ETV6mutant MNKPL cells (Fig.
4G
).
The cell differentiation trajectory in MNKPL cells determined by single-cell analyses
Differentiation of HSCs into the lymphoid progenitor cell lineage, including common lymphoid progenitor-like hematopoietic progenitor cells
(23)
and then into NK cells proceeds gradually and in parallel with myeloid cell progenitors
(24)
. To clarify the origin of MNKPL cells, a differentiation trajectory analysis was performed using scRNA-seq data. To this end, we examined the positional relationships of MNKPL cells during hematopoiesis on the basis of normal hematopoietic cell types (BM-derived CD34 + HSCs, progenitors, and mononuclear cells). ETV6 wild-type and ETV6mutant MNKPL cells were visualized in k-nearest neighbor graphs based on the SPRING pipeline, which connected all single cells. The results revealed putative differentiation trajectories, including a trajectory of a continuum of cells from HSCs/MPPs to each cell type lineage, with several intermediate states and gene expression gradients. The data showed MNKPL to be closely connected with HSCs/MPPs, myeloid progenitors, monocytes, and NK cells (Fig.
5A
, fig.
S10A,
and
table S11
). Next, pseudotime analysis was performed to determine the differentiation status of MNKPL cells. ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cell differentiation was identified during the middle of the lymphoid and myeloid lineage cell differentiation process (fig.
S10B
and
table S9
). The HSC/MPP signature overlapped with ETV6-mutant MNKPL cells, whereas the neutrophil-myeloid progenitor signature profoundly overlapped with ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cells (Fig.
5B
and table
S9
). These findings suggest that compared with ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cells, the differentiation status of ETV6-mutant MNKPL cells is close to that of HSCs.
Clinical characteristics and outcomes of MNKPL
In our cohort, 11 patients were treated with AML-type chemotherapy, and 4 were treated with ALL/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)-type chemotherapy. Complete remission after induction therapy was achieved in 47% of the patients. The remission rates of patients after AML or ALL/NHL-type induction therapy were 45 and 50%, respectively. Furthermore, 13 patients underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The median follow-up period was 3.2 (0.1 to 16.0) years (Fig.
6A
); the 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 36.7 and 35.6%, respectively (Fig.
6B
). As L-asparaginase (L-Asp) has been shown to reduce NK cell activity in the screening of various chemotherapeutic agents
(25,
26)
, it has frequently been applied for NK cell-type leukemia treatment
(27,
28)
. In our study, the patients who had received L-Asp combined with AML-type chemotherapy showed superior survival (5-year OS of 100% versus 29.7%) compared to those who received other types of chemotherapy (Fig.
6C
). From a genomic perspective, no difference in outcome between ETV6-mutant and ETV6 wild-type patients was observed (fig.
S11A
). The outcomes combined with our cohort and published data (table
S12
) are presented in figs. S11 (B to E). Overall, the outcomes for children and AYAs were better than those for adults (5year OS of 32.8% versus 0%) (fig.
S11C
).
L-Asp sensitivity and ASNS expression in MNKPL cells
To explore therapeutic targets for MNKPL, sensitivity to 79 drugs, including conventional chemotherapeutic agents and molecular targeting agents, was determined by comparing the responses of ETV6 wild-type and ETV6-mutant MNKPL cells with those of AML and T-ALL cells (tables S13 and S14). L-Asp was selected as the focus based on its proven clinical effectiveness, and MNKPL cells met the definition of "good response" to L-Asp (see Materials and Methods). Furthermore, ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cells had a higher drug effect score (DES) than ETV6-mutant MNKPL cells (Fig.
6D
). In most human cells, L-asparagine deficiency can be offset by activation of an alternative synthetic pathway for asparagine synthetase (ASNS). Notably, depletion of L-asparagine from plasma by L-Asp induced tumor cell death, as these cells could not synthesize L-asparagine through ASNS. The expression of ASNS was evaluated using RNA-seq data, and ETV6 wild-type MNKPL showed reduced ASNS expression when compared to AML, T-ALL, and MPAL (Fig.
6E
). The DNA methylation level of the ASNS promoter was also much higher than that in AML (Fig.
6F
). These observations confirm the utility of L-Asp as a treatment for MNKPL.
Therapeutic targets for MNKPL
The sensitivity to 79 drugs is shown in table S14. Drugs categorized as good response (see Materials and Methods) in two MNKPL cell types are shown in Fig.
7A
. Among them, MNKPL cells showed a "very good response" (see Materials and Methods) to idelalisib, rapamycin, AZD1480, lenvatinib, ABT-199, RG-7112, EPZ005687,  vorinostat, and apabetalone (Fig.
7A
). Our genomic analysis showed that genes involved in the NOTCH, MAPK, and PI3K-AKT pathways were mutated at a high frequency in MNKPL cells. Combining the results for the genomic landscape and in vitro drug screening tests, we believe that the PI3K-AKT pathway is an important target worthy of further attention. Accordingly, the PI3K-AKT pathway was assessed by GSEA, revealing high PIK3R2 expression and high sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 in MNKPL cells (Fig.
7
, B to D). Despite minor gene alterations, GSEA-based expression profiling of genes or pathways targeted by the above compounds showed enrichment of the apoptosis, transcription coregulator, VEGF, and TP53 pathways. The VEGF pathway was identified as an up-regulated pathway in MNKPL compared to T-ALL and AML, as mentioned above (fig.
S3, B
and
C
: "signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases" and "epidermal growth factor (EGF)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway"). An association was observed between the expression of VEGFB and sensitivity to lenvatinib, BCL2 and ABT-199, and BRD4 and apabetalone (fig.
S12
).
S9
). The expression of genes or gene sets is shown as a heatmap.
DISCUSSION
We conducted a multiomics study including a comprehensive genomic analysis, transcriptome analysis, epigenetic modification analysis, and scRNA-seq to clarify MNKPL characteristics. Activation of the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, high RUNX3 expression, and low BCL11B expression were identified as hallmarks of MNKPL. These findings were reproduced with an NK cell differentiation assay using KG-1 cells. Moreover, trajectory analysis using scRNA-seq data showed that the MNKPL cell component was located in the middle of the trajectory of HSC/MPP differentiation into NK cells.
Classically, NK cells have been considered to derive from common lymphoid progenitors. However, lymphoid lineage cell development based on the myeloid-based model has been proposed
(11)
. In this model, HSCs initially generate myelo-erythroid progenitors and myelolymphoid progenitors (MLPs). T cell and B cell progenitors subsequently arise from MLPs through myeloid T cell and myeloid B cell stages, respectively. MLPs have lost B cell differentiation potential but can still generate myeloid cells, dendritic cells, and NK cells
(29,
30)
. These observations suggest that NK cells and myeloid cells share common progenitors. NOTCH signaling pathway activation is crucial for T cell lineage commitment
(31)
, and Bcl11b is a crucial TF involved in T cell development. Loss of Bcl11b expression induces complete developmental arrest at the double negative (DN) 2 T cell stage, a Bcl11b-driven checkpoint; at this point, T cell progenitors fail to terminate into non-T cell lines and commit to a T cell lineage
(9)
. Bcl11b is also needed in committed and mature T cells to restrict access to NK cell programs
(32,
33)
. Our observation of NOTCH signaling pathway activation and reduced BCL11B expression in leukemia cells strongly supports this model. We also found high RUNX3 expression in leukemia cells. Runx3 plays an important role in NK cell development
(15)
. We hypothesize that MNKPL arises through the following mechanism. Initially, HSCs/MPPs are committed myeloid T and NK cell progenitors induced by NOTCH signaling activation, after which attenuated expression of BCL11B blocks T cell commitment, and RUNX3 expression induces NK cell commitment (fig.
S13
).
CD56 is occasionally expressed in AML
(34)
. However, in terms of negative MPO staining, MNKPL is completely different from CD56-positive AML. With regard to immunological phenotype, some patients with MNKPL fall into the AML FAB M0 (WHO classification: AML-NOS) category. However, the mutation profile of AML FAB M0 is characterized by RUNX1 mutation, not NOTCH1 mutation
(35)
. FAB M0 and MNKPL differ with respect to RUNX1 mutation. NK cell lymphoblastic leukemia (NKLL), which expresses CD56, is characterized by NOTCH1, ETV6, and Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3) mutations
(36)
. MNKPL differs from NKLL in terms of extramedullary involvement, the negativity of cytoplasmic CD3, lack of JAK3 mutations, resistance to ALL-type chemotherapy, and poor prognosis. Although a limitation of our study is that no comprehensive genomic analysis focusing on CD56-positive AML FAB M0 and NKLL for comparison with MNKPL was performed, patients with MNKPL can be accurately diagnosed by extramedullary involvement, flow cytometry findings (table
S1
), and NOTCH1 mutation or expression in a clinical setting. Now, MNKPL is categorized as "MPAL, rare types" in the WHO classification, but our study revealed that MNKPL constitutes a group that differs from MPAL. Therefore, MNKPL might be identified as an independent disease category in the next WHO classification revision.
In our study, patients with MNKPL were subdivided into two groups on the basis of ETV6 mutation status. The most critical physiological role for ETV6 in hematopoiesis is related to its capacity to maintain HSC stemness. ETV6 also has a function in the transition of normal hematopoiesis from the fetal liver to the BM
(37)
. ETV6 heterozygous, pathological somatic, and germline mutations have been detected in various hematological malignancies
(38,
39)
. Our findings indicate that ETV6 mutation contributes to the acquisition of an HSC-like phenotype, presumably due to differentiation arrest or differences in the origin of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Comparison of an HSC-like subgroup in ETV6 wild-type and ETV6-mutant MNKPLs showed unique expression profiles, whereby the former was characterized by AP1 pathway gene enrichment. Up-regulated expression of AP1 pathway genes has been identified in the LSC subset of AML via scRNA-seq
(40)
. This finding suggests that ETV6-mutant MNKPL cells originate from undifferentiated HSCs/MPPs but that ETV6 wild-type MNKPL cells originate from MLPs. Similarly, somatic ETV6 mutations have been observed in up to 33% of patients with ETP-ALL
(41,
42)
. The ETV6::MAML3 fusion detected in a patient has been reported in another case of T cell-myeloid MPAL
(43)
. ETV6 alteration is not specific for the T cell lineage. This fusion may characterize an immature phenotype of leukemic cells, and the addition of NOTCH1 mutation or RUNX3 hyperexpression may potentiate myeloid NK cell potential.
In general, the prognosis of MNKPL is unsatisfactory, even when HCT is performed. Therefore, the development of therapeutic approaches is urgent. L-Asp has been traditionally used for treating MNKPL, and our in vitro sensitivity assay and ASNS expression analysis confirmed that L-Asp is a reasonable treatment option. Furthermore, unbiased drug screening and comprehensive mutational and expression analyses identified PI-103 as a PI3K inhibitor, ABT-199 as a BCL2 inhibitor, lenvatinib as a VEGFR inhibitor, and apabetalone as a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family inhibitor for molecular targeted therapy. Accurate diagnosis and the application of L-Asp combined with AML-type chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, and HCT may improve the outcome of patients with MNKPL.
Because of the rarity of MNKPL, the small numbers of patients enrolled and the number of samples used in analyses were limitations of this study. We agree that a small subject number is not ideal for omics analysis. However, the results of the RNA-seq, DNA methylation array, and SNF analyses carried out in this research are ensured by statistical methods, and the quality of the results is strengthened when these analyses are combined.
A worldwide-based collection of clinical information and samples and further research are needed. Prospective clinical trials based on our findings may improve MNKPL outcomes.
In conclusion, a comprehensive multiomics analysis was performed in this study, and the results were consolidated to identify the disease characteristics of MNKPL. Moreover, a comprehensive drug screen combined with multiomics data analysis revealed molecular targets for treating MNKPL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics and outcomes and cell biological and genetic features of MNKPL and was conducted according to International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guideline. To collect clinical information and analyze outcomes, questionnaires were used. WES, WGS, RNAseq, DNA methylation array, and scRNA-seq as multiomics approaches were conducted to elucidate genetic and epigenetic features using patient samples. In addition, for more accurate clustering of the MNKPL group, integrated clustering using SNF analysis on RNA expression and DNA methylation array data was performed. To validate the genetic features of MNKPL, a functional NK cell differentiation assay was conducted using KG-1 cells, an undifferentiated leukemia cell line. A high-throughput drug sensitivity screening was performed to validate the effect of L-Asp on MNKPL in the clinical setting and to elucidate molecular targets for MNKPL.
Nationwide survey
The Leukemia and Lymphoma Committee of JSPHO sent out two questionnaires to 110 JSPHO-affiliated hospitals. The first questionnaire requested details on the number of pediatric patients with MNKPL who had been diagnosed between 2000 and 2013. The second questionnaire requested more detailed information about clinical courses. OS and EFS, defined as relapse or death, were analyzed. The protocol of this retrospective study was approved by the review boards of JSPHO and Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital. The research protocol, including genomic analysis using patient samples, was approved by the Review Board of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (G2000-103). All patients or parents provided written informed consent for this study.
Literature review
The literature review was performed by searching the PubMed database using the key words "Myeloid" and "Natural killer" and "leukemia" or "Myeloid" and "NK" and "leukemia" and the Japanese literature database ICHUSHI (
https://www.jamas.or.jp/service/ ichu/search.html
) using the same key words in Japanese. The sample availability was asked by e-mail to each corresponding author.
Whole-exome sequencing WES was performed using genomic DNA from tumor samples and germline samples of peripheral blood cells collected at the time of complete remission. Exome capture was carried out using SureSelect QXT reagents or SureSelect low-input XT (Agilent Technologies); massively parallel sequencing was performed using the GAIIx or HiSeq 1500 platform (Illumina) with 100-base pair (bp) paired-end reads or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with 150-bp pairedend reads. The sequence data were processed using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)/Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) inhouse pipeline, which aligned the reads, variant allele frequency, and variant effects annotated by ANNOVAR. Tumor/germline pair analysis was carried out using Mutect2 (
https://gatk. broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593851-Mutect2
). The tumor-only mode of Mutect2 was used for a case without an available germline sample.
Variants were filtered by removing results of fewer than five reads, synonymous variants, and an allele frequency greater than 0.05 in Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and less than 10 in Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) phred score. Somatic copy number variants (CNVs) in the samples that were not analyzed by WGS were detected using VarScan2 (
https://varscan.sourceforge.net/index.html
). The BAM files in tumor and germline samples were processed by circular binary segmentation, and sets of somatic CNVs were called with the DNA copy package in which segmented calls were defined by substantial change points of at least 3 SDs. Large-scale (>25% of a chromosome arm) or focal (<25%) events in somatic CNVs were identified through a merging procedure. CVNs greater than 0.3 or less than -0.3 were considered to indicate pathological amplification or deletion, respectively.
Whole-genome sequencing WGS was performed using genomic DNA from tumor samples. The NEBNext DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) was used to prepare the library, and massively parallel sequencing was conducted using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) with 150-bp pairedend reads. For WGS analysis, reads were mapped to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37) reference human genome assembly using BWA and sorted and deduplicated using SAMtools. GenomonSV software of the Genomon Project (
https://github.com/Genomon-Project
) was applied to call structural variants.
RNA sequencing
RNA-seq was performed using high-quality RNA isolated from tumor samples with the RNeasy Mini Kit or AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) or SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit (TaKaRa Bio) was used to prepare the library, and massively parallel sequencing was carried out using the HiSeq 1500 or NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) with 100-or 150-bp pairedend reads, respectively.
To compare the expression profile of MNKPL to that of AML, T-ALL, MPAL, and BPDCN, we used previously published primary AML (GSE108266), T-ALL (GSE110637), MPAL (GSE113601), and BPDCN (GSE84471) datasets. Our and public sequence reads were aligned to GRCh37 using STAR 2.7.8a
(44)
. Count data were calculated by featureCounts and normalized using R package edgeR (normalized count of trimmed mean of M value). A heatmap of these data was generated using the R package pheatmap. Pearson correlation metrics were applied for unsupervised clustering. PCA plots were generated using the R package ggplot2. The PCA is conducted using Euclidean distance as the distance metric. GSEA was performed with GSEA v4.1.0. Unsupervised pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted using GOrilla
(45,
46)
and REVIGO
(47)
.
DNA methylation array
DNA methylation analysis was performed with genomic DNA from tumor samples by Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (Illumina). Library construction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. To evaluate the DNA methylation profile of MNKPL compared to that of AML, T-ALL, and MPAL, previously published datasets of primary AML [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program TCGA-LAML], T-ALL (GSE49031), and MPAL samples (GSE113545) were used. Our and public raw methylation data were processed and normalized using the Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline (ChAMP)
(48)
. Then, the normalized β value was calculated. A heatmap of hierarchical clustering was generated using the R package pheatmap.
SNF analysis
We performed SNF analysis to assess the integrated gene expression/DNA methylation profile of MNKPL compared to that of MPAL
(49)
. Samples of MNKPL (n = 6) and MPAL (n = 24), which were analyzed by both DNA methylation array and RNAseq, were selected. The 100, 500, and 1000 most differentially expressed genes identified through RNA-seq and the 1000 most differentially methylated probes in the DNA methylation array ranked by SD in 30 samples of MNKPL and MPAL were selected. SNF parameters were set to K = 10, alpha = 0.5, and T = 20. The data were processed with the R package SNF tool, and consensus clustering of the 30 samples with Pearson correlation metrics was performed using the R package ConsensusClusterPlus.
Cell sorting for scRNA-seq MNKPL tumor cells from two patients were purified from lymph node or BM samples at the time of diagnosis. Normal BM mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) and CD34 + normal BM cells were obtained from one healthy donor and purified. Cell sorting was performed with a BD FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). MNKPL and CD34 + normal BM cells were sorted on the basis of cell surface expression of CD45 dim CD56 + and Lin -CD34 + by lymphocyte gating [forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) gating], respectively. Antibodies against CD56-PC5 (Beckman Coulter, #A07789, RRID:AB_1575976), CD45-BV421 (BioLegend, #368522, RRID:AB_2687375), lineage cocktail 1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (for staining CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, and CD56) (BD Biosciences, #340546, RRID:AB_400053), CD34-phycoerythrin cyanin (PC7) (Beckman Coulter, #A21691, RRID: not available), and CD56-Alexa Fluor 700 (BioLegend, #318316, RRID:AB_604104) were used for staining. Normal BMMNCs were purified by lymphocyte and monocyte gating (FSC versus SSC gating). All live cells were also gated into 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-111-568)-negative or SYTOX Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #S34857)-negative and doubletnegative populations.
Single-cell RNA-seq scRNA-seq was performed using the BD Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System [BD Rhapsody Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) Amplification Kit, BD Biosciences]. Purified MNKPL tumor cells, normal BMMNCs, and CD34 + cells were tagged for multiplex analysis using the BD Human Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit (BD Biosciences). High-throughput sequencing was conducted using the NextSeq 500 or HiSeq X platform (Illumina) with 150-bp paired-end reads. Paired-end scRNA-seq reads were processed using the BD Rhapsody WTA bioinformatics workflow (BD Biosciences) on the Seven Bridges Genomics cloud platform and aligned using STAR. After identifying the cell barcode and unique molecular index (UMI), recursive substitution error correction (RSEC) counts as the final molecular counts were calculated by removing the effect of UMI errors. RSEC counts were used for downstream analysis. The gene counts for each cell were normalized by counts per 10,000 reads. Cells were excluded on the basis of a quality check (QC): more than 20% mitochondrial reads and less than 10 expressed genes or more than 2000 expressed genes.
For each dataset, PCA was performed on the basis of the most variable genes, which are listed in table
S9
. The elbow method was implemented to determine the number of clusters. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for two-dimensional data visualization using the PCA data was executed. We used PhenoGraph based on PCA data for clustering by unsupervised nearest-neighbor grouping and overlaid the UMAP data.
Monocle was applied for trajectory analysis based on the most variable genes in each dataset. Furthermore, we used SPRING (
https://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html
)
(50)
, which is a tool for uncovering high-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data, to perform a trajectory analysis by visualizing contacts in each cell. The normal hematopoietic differentiation trajectory was visualized using normal CD34 + BM cells, and BMMNCs and tumor cells of MNKPL were overlaid onto this trajectory map through the subplot method. The processing parameters for SPRING are shown in table
S11
.
Unsupervised pathway analysis was carried out using Metascape software (
https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1
). Downstream analysis after QC, except for SPRING, was performed using SeqGeq version 1.7.0 (BD Biosciences) and R version 4.0.2. Gene sets of hematopoietic cells from a previous report were used
(51)
.
NK cell differentiation assay
An in vitro NK cell differentiation assay was performed using KG-1 cells. KG-1 is an immature myeloid cell line that expresses CD45, CD33, and CD34 but not CD56, CD3, and CD19. KG-1 cells were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (#JCRB0065, RRID:CVCL_0374). KG-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine and phenol red (Wako), which was supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Nichirei) and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The coding sequence of RUNX3 in the Flexi ORF Clone FXC20145 (Kazusa Genome Technologies) was subcloned and inserted into the Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV)-internal ribosomal entry site-green fluorescent protein vector. RUNX3-expressing retrovirus was produced by cotransfection with a packaging plasmid pam into 293T cells
(52)
. Viral supernatants were collected for 2 days, concentrated overnight with Retro-X Concentrator (TaKaRa), and used to infect KG-1 cells with protamine (8 μg/ml).
RUNX3-or mock-expressing KG-1 cells were cocultured for 14 days on OP9-DLL1 stromal cells and IL-2 (0, 20, or 40 ng/ml) (Miltenyi Biotec), IL-7 (0 or 10 ng/ml), IL-15 (0 or 20 ng/ml), Flt3L (0 or 10 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (SCF) (0 or 20 ng/ml) (R&D Systems). Antibodies against the following were used to analyze KG-1 cell surface markers: CD33-peridinin-chlorophyll-protein (PerCP)/Cyanine5.5 (BioLegend, #303414, RRID:AB_2074241), CD34-PC7 (Beckman Coulter, #A21691, RRID: not available), CD7-phycoerythrin (PE) (BioLegend, #343106, RRID: AB_1732011), CD3-ECD (Beckman Coulter, #A07748, RRID: AB_1575956), CD45-VioGreen (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-110-638, RRID:AB_2658245), and CD56-Alexa Fluor 700 (BioLegend, #318316, RRID:AB_604104). SYTOX Blue Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #S34857) was used to eliminate dead cells. Data analysis of CD56 expression was conducted using biological triplicate samples. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo 10 software (BD Biosciences).
Western blotting
Aliquots containing 1 × 10 6 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in tris-glycine-native (TGN) buffer [150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1% Tween-20, and 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] containing protease inhibitor (100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes, and the blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma-Aldrich, #A8592-2MG, RRID:AB_439702) and rabbit anti-structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (SMC1) antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, #A300-055A, RRID:AB_2192467). The primary antibodies were detected by the binding of HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, #NA934, AB_772206), which was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare).
High-throughput drug sensitivity screening
High-throughput drug sensitivity screening was performed following the procedures described in previous reports
(53,
54)
. Seventynine drugs were added to primary MNKPL, AML, and T-ALL samples suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako) with 20% FBS (Nichirei). The list of drugs and the final concentrations are shown in tables S13 and S14. Cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo luminescent assays with a GloMax plate reader (Promega).
DES was used to evaluate drug sensitivity. Details of the methods used for calculating DES have been previously described
(53,
54)
. A DES of 100 indicated that all cells were killed at all drug concentrations tested; a DES of 0 indicated that the drug exerted no effect. In this study, good response was defined as a DES of more than 10.0 and more than 2.5-fold higher than the mean DES of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Among the drugs with a good response, very good response was defined as a DES greater than 20.0.
Statistical analysis
An unpaired t test with a two-tailed P value was used for comparison of two groups. We conducted an unpaired t test with Welch's correction when P values in the F test were less than 0.05. P values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used Prism 8 software for statistical analysis.
