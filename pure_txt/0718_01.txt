Crohn's disease
RNA sequencing
CXCL1
Background: Aberrant gene expression in the gut mucosa might contribute to the initiation and progression of Crohn's disease (CD). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides precise measurements of expression levels of transcripts and their isoforms. The aim of this study was to use RNA-seq to investigate transcriptomic differences and identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts in inflamed and noninflamed intestinal mucosa of CD patients.
Methods: RNA-seq was performed on 13 pairs of inflamed and noninflamed intestinal mucosa from 13 CD patients and on sex-matched normal mucosa of 13 healthy controls. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were validated by immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: RNA-seq revealed genome-wide transcriptomic differences between normal mucosa, noninflamed, and inflamed CD mucosa. Among 950 differentially expressed genes, 19 were up-or downregulated (upregulation: ANGPT2, CHN1, CPXM1, CPZ, CXCL1, FCN3, GJC1, HSD11B1, LZTS1, MEOX1, MMP12, PLA1A, SERPINE1, SGIP1, and TRPC4; downregulation: FAM189A1, PDE6A, SLC38A4, and HMGCS2) with statistical significance (p , 0.01 and q , 0.05). Among them, CXCL1 exhibited the highest fold change between groups. Immunohistochemistry for CXCL1 revealed no expression in normal mucosa, slightly increased expression in noninflamed CD mucosa, and highly increased expression in inflamed CD mucosa. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that CXCL1 expression was significantly associated with epithelial damage, increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and submucosal fibrosis. Serum CXCL1 concentration measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was better correlated with CD activity index (r ¼ 0.660) than with C-reactive protein (r ¼ 0.204).
Conclusions: RNA-seq revealed transcriptomic differences between normal mucosa, noninflamed CD mucosa, and inflamed CD mucosa. Intestinal and serum CXCL1 was substantially increased with CD activity and can be used as a potential biomarker of CD.
High-throughput microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are state-of-the-art techniques used to investigate genome-wide transcriptome expression.
5
Although microarray is a well-established method,
6
RNA-seq provides a far more precise measurement of expression levels of transcripts and their isoforms compared with other methods.
7
Recent studies that systematically compared microarrays and RNA-seq clearly demonstrated the superiority of the latter method with respect to both the low frequency of false-positive signals and the high degree of reproducibility.
8,
9
Moreover, the results of previous transcriptome profiling of CD analyzed by microarray have been largely discordant,
5,
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
whereas genome-wide expression analysis using RNA-seq for CD has only rarely been reported.
This study employed RNA-seq to evaluate whole transcriptomic changes in distinct regions of inflamed ulcerated mucosa of CD (IMCD) and noninflamed macroscopically normal-looking mucosa of CD (NMCD), as compared with the normal mucosa of healthy controls (HC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We collected 13 pairs of IMCD and NMCD samples from 13 CD patients (mean age 30.9 6 10.9 yrs; male; n ¼ 7) during endoscopy. CD was diagnosed and classified based on established diagnostic guidelines.
15,
16
The clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients were as follows: Montreal classification (A1/A2/ A3, n ¼ 2/8/3; L1/L2/L3/L4, n ¼ 6/2/5/0; B1/B2/B3, n ¼ 5/5/3), use of medication at tissue acquisition (no/yes [corticosteroid/ azathioprine/infliximab], n ¼ 9/4 [1/1/2]), and activity 1 year after biopsy (active [CD activity index, CDAI, $ 150]/inactive [CDAI , 150], n ¼ 3/10). IMCD samples were obtained from the ulcerated ileocecal mucosa of CD patients (6 cases of IMCD were obtained from the ileal mucosa [Montreal classification: L1 type], and 7 cases were obtained from the colonic mucosa [Montreal classification: L2 and L3 types]), whereas NMCD samples were obtained from macroscopically normal-looking colonic mucosa (without histologic examination) located at least 10 cm from inflamed mucosa. HC samples were obtained from normal-looking colonic mucosa located 10 cm from the ileocecal valve (ascending colon) in 13 healthy sex-matched individuals during screening colonoscopy. At least 4 endoscopic biopsy samples were obtained using standard biopsy forceps (FB-22C-1; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) from each of IMCD, NMCD, and HC patients. After endoscopic biopsy, tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C.
To validate the differentially expressed transcripts identified by RNA-seq for CD, 49 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CD tissues were obtained from different patients during surgery (segmental small bowel resection, n ¼ 7; ileocecectomy, n ¼ 14; segmental resection of small bowel and colon, n ¼ 8; and segmental colonic resection, n ¼ 20). Histologic assessment was undertaken for epithelial damage, architectural changes, infiltration of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells in the lamina propria (LP), presence of ulcers, and submucosal fibrosis by the same experienced pathologist.
17
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed using the same FFPE CD samples to confirm changes in messenger RNA and protein expression identified by RNA-seq. To assess the usefulness of the identified genes as potential serum biomarkers, 71 serum samples obtained from CD patients with variable activities and 50 serum samples from normal controls were collected and analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Table

shows the clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients.
Total RNA Extraction and RNA-seq
Total RNA was isolated from 39 fresh-frozen tissue samples (13 pairs of IMCD and NMCD and 13 HC) and extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA quality and quantity were determined using a Nanodrop 8000 UV-Vis spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA-seq was performed using total RNA samples with a quantity greater than 10 mg and an RNA integrity number .6.0. If the quantity of total RNA was less than 10 mg or the RNA integrity number was less than 6.0, another biopsy sample was used for RNA isolation.
Library construction for whole transcriptome sequencing was performed using the Truseq RNA sample preparation v2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Isolated total RNA (2 mg) was used in reverse transcription reactions with poly(dT) primers and Super-ScriptTM II RT (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, the RNA-seq library was prepared through complementary DNA amplification, end-repair, 3 0 end adenylation, adapter ligation, and amplification. The quality and concentration of the library were measured using the Bioanalyzer and Qubit instruments, respectively. Sequencing of the transcriptome library was carried out using the 100-bp paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster Kit and the TruSeq Rapid SBS Kit (Illumina).
RNA-seq Data Analysis
Reads from FASTQ format files were mapped against the University of California-Santa Cruz Homo sapiens reference genome hg19 using TopHat version 2.0.6 with the default parameters (
http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/
). The mapping results were analyzed by HTSeq version 0.6.1 to quantify transcript abundance.
18
Coding genes were selected, and raw read counts were normalized by trimmed mean of M-values normalization. Pearson correlation coefficients of gene expression profiles were measured between samples to determine differences in gene expression profiles among groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected by the DESeq R package based on P values and false discovery rate-adjusted P values.
19
Functional Enrichment Analysis
The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery v6.7, a set of web-based functional annotation tools, was used to annotate DEGs. A unique list of symbols of over-and underexpressed genes (.2-fold) was uploaded via the web interface and compared with the H. sapiens background gene list. The functional category biological process in gene ontology (GO) was selected for functional annotation.
Real-time qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was performed using Taqman probes for CXCL1, MMP12, and ATCB (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Confirmatory real-time qRT-PCR was performed with RNA used for the RNA-seq. The CXCL1 and ATCB genes were amplified with Taqman probes (Thermo Scientific Inc.). The fold changes of CXCL1 gene expression in the NMCD and IMCD samples were analyzed relative to the control (HC) samples with ATCB as a standard, using the ΔC T method. Total RNA was isolated from 49 FFPE tissues using an RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fold change of gene expression for CXCL1 relative to ATCB was analyzed according to architectural changes, infiltration of PMN leukocytes in the LP, and the presence of ulcers and submucosal fibrosis and further analyzed using the Student's t test or analysis of variance where appropriate. In all cases, P ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Immunohistochemical Staining
Tissue sections (4 mm thick) obtained from FFPE tissues that were representative of IMCD and NMCD, along with freshfrozen HC tissues, were stained with antihuman CXCL1 antibody (GRO alpha Antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:4000 and antihuman MMP12 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:1000.
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays
Venous blood samples were obtained from CD patients, and sera for CXCL1 measurements were stored at 2708C until analysis. CXCL1 in sera was quantified using the CXCL1 (GRO alpha) Human SimpleStep ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum concentrations of CXCL1 from CD patients and controls were measured using ELISA and analyzed with the Student's t test and analysis of variance to compare active CD, inactive CD, and control samples. Pearson correlation was used to compare levels of serum C-reactive protein and CDAI. In all cases, P ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethical Considerations
All patients and controls were recruited at Samsung Medical Center after written informed consent was obtained. The institutional review board approved the study protocol.
RESULTS
Transcriptomic Alterations in Inflamed and Noninflamed Mucosa of CD Patients
RNA-seq was performed for 13 pairs of tissues representing IMCD and NMCD and for 13 HC samples. Across all 39 samples, the median total number of reads produced for each sample was 31,061,521. There was no significant difference in the number of reads and unique hits to the reference genome between the IMCD, NMCD, and HC samples (P . 0.12, see Supplementary Material 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/
B473). Between 84.2% and 95.5% of reads aligned to the reference genome in a unique manner. A small percentage of reads  (0.001%-0.4%) were removed from the analysis before reference mapping due to low quality.
DEG analysis using the R-based DESeq package identified a total of 950 genes differentially expressed between all groups and the top 10 up-and downregulated genes between the IMCD, NMCD, and HC groups (P , 0.05 and P , 0.1, see Supplementary Material 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
). The gene expression profiles of the samples were visualized and compared using heat maps and unsupervised hierarchical trees (Fig.
1
). DEGs in the mucosa of CD (IMCD and NMCD) clustered together and were generally upregulated compared with those of HC. In addition, gene expression in IMCD tended to be generally upregulated compared with that of NMCD.
Pairwise correlation analysis was performed to determine whether the observed gene expression alterations in IMCD, NMCD, and HC correlated with the different subgroups classified based on clinical characteristics (Fig.
2
). Pearson's correlation coefficients were measured between samples to determine the difference in gene expression profiles according to Montreal classification, medication, and activity 1 year after biopsies. IMCD samples exhibited a strong correlation with NMCD irrespective of Montreal classification, use of medication, and activity 1 year after biopsies (Pearson's coefficient . 0.7), but the correlation with HC was weaker. In a principal component analysis for RNA-seq-based genome-wide expression profiles, the HC samples were clustered apart from the IMCD and NMCD samples (Fig.
3
). Principal component analysis revealed an apparent separation between IMCD and HC; however, there was no apparent separation between IMCD and NMCD or NMCD and HC.
GO and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of DEGs
To understand the biological meaning of DEGs, GO and pathway analysis of DEGs in IMCD and NMCD (referenced to HC) were conducted. The most prominent biological processes of GO were as follows (see Supplementary Material 3, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
): immune response (GO:0006955), cell adhesion (GO:007155), cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motion (GO:0006928), inflammatory response (GO:0006954), homeostasis process (GO:0042592), and chemotaxis (GO:0006935). Gene set enrichment analyses were performed to identify genes with significant differences between groups of expression profiles and to simultaneously determine their biological meanings by employing biological pathway analyses (Fig.
4
). Looking specifically at upregulated genes, the prominently overrepresented pathways included those for hematopoietic cell lineage (hsa04640), chemokine signaling (hsa04062), intestinal immune network for IgA production (hsa04672), cell adhesion molecules (hsa04514), osteoclast differentiation (hsa04380), and phagosomes (hsa04145). In addition, a heat map was generated based on expression values of normalized read counts of T helper cell-associated genes, antimicrobial peptides, and chemokines (Fig.
5
). The expression of T helper-associated genes and chemokines was substantially increased in IMCD and NMCD compared with HC. In addition, the expression of T helper-associated genes and chemokines tended to increase in IMCD compared with NMCD.
Significantly Differentially Expressed Transcripts Between IMCD, NMCD, and HC
When we filtered 950 significantly DEGs using a threshold of P ,0.01 and fold change in expression .2 or ,0.5 between groups, we identified the differential expression of 19 genes common to IMCD, NMCD, and HC (Fig.
6
). Fifteen genes, including ANGPT2, CHN1, CPXM1, CPZ, CXCL1, FCN3, GJC1, HSD11B1, LZTS1, MEOX1, MMP12, PLA1A, SER-PINE1, SGIP1, and TRPC4, were more highly expressed in IMCD and subsequently decreased in NMCD and HC, whereas 4 genes (FAM189A1, HMGCS2, PDE6A, and SLC38A4) were less expressed in IMCD and subsequently increased in NMCD and HC (see Supplementary Material 4, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
). Furthermore, when we performed DEG analysis using only colonic samples (IMCD with L2 or L3 type, n ¼ 7; NMCD, n ¼ 13; and HC, n ¼ 13), CXCL1 exhibited the highest fold change between groups (see Supplementary Material 7, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
).
Among the genes identified above, CXCL1 and MMP12 exhibited the highest fold change between groups and have been proposed to have a functional association with CD. Immunohistochemical staining using CXCL1 and MMP12 antibodies showed no staining in the HC samples but significantly increased expression with the NMCD and IMCD samples (Fig.
7
). Confirmatory qRT-PCR performed with RNA used for the RNA-seq showed that CXCL1 expression was increased in IMCD and in NMCD relative to HC (see Supplementary Material 5, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
). To validate the increased expression of CXCL1 in CD, 49 FFPE CD tissues were obtained from surgery specimens (from different patients than those used for RNA-seq) and subjected to histologic assessment (Fig.
8
).
17
qRT-PCR using RNA extracted from 49 FFPE CD tissues showed that CXCL1 transcription was significantly increased between samples, correlating with epithelial damage (P ¼ 0.018), increased infiltration of PMN leukocytes in LP (P ¼ 0.009), and the presence of submucosal fibrosis (P ¼ 0.004). ELISA was performed using 71 serum samples obtained from CD patients and 50 serum samples of controls (Fig.
9A
, see Supplementary Material 6, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
). Serum CXCL1 concentration was increased substantially in HC, inactive CD patients, and active CD patients (P , 0.001). The expression of CDAI correlated more with serum CXCL1 concentration (r ¼ 0.660, P , 0.001) than with C-reactive protein (r ¼ 0.214, P ¼ 0.089; Fig.
9B
).
Finally, we were interested in identifying features of alternative splicing, such as exon skipping, mutually exclusive exons, alternative start and stop codons, and intron retention, between IMCD and HC samples. To this end, the RNA-seq data were annotated using the multivariate analysis of transcript  splicing program MATS.
20
We did not identify any significant alternative splicing events between the IMCD and HC samples (see Supplementary Material 8, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ RNA-seq analysis to evaluate genome-wide transcriptome changes in adult CD patients. Recently, Haberman et al
21
and Holgersen et al
22
reported RNA-seq results in patients with CD; however, they evaluated the expression of target genes or enrolled only pediatric CD patients. Microarray technology is limited to detecting transcripts that correspond to existing genomic sequencing information, whereas RNA-seq is able to facilitate investigation of both known and unknown transcripts. In the present study, we prospectively collected samples to compare normal mucosa, noninflamed CD mucosa, and inflamed CD mucosa to allow for discovery of the alterations of whole transcriptome expression. Using RNA-seq, we confirmed known transcriptomic differences and identified substantial increases in the expression of CXCL1 in IMCD and NMCD compared with HC.
CXCL1 is a member of the CXC chemokine family, having neutrophil chemoattractant activity, and is expressed mainly in neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells.
23,
24
Acute inflammation is characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators culminating in an initial but transient recruitment of PMN leukocytes, followed by prolonged macrophage accumulation.
25
Both dendritic and epithelial cells have been proposed as originators of the signals responsible for the accumulation of PMN leukocytes in experimental models of inflammation, through secretion of chemokines including mCXCL1.
26
CXC chemokines, including CXCL1, rapidly attract PMN leukocytes, which infiltrate the inflamed tissue in response to chemotactic signals produced by the tissue.
27
A heat map of the expression levels of chemokines in our RNA-seq analysis revealed that upregulation of CXC chemokines was more prominent than that of other chemokines. Among CXC chemokines, the expression of CXCL1 was the most prominent and was confirmed by qRT-PCR, which showed that CXCL1 transcript levels correlated with PMN infiltration in LP. Likewise, immunohistochemistry revealed no expression in normal mucosa, slightly increased expression in noninflamed CD mucosa, and highly increased expression in inflamed CD mucosa. A previous study reported that the priming effect of PMNs in CD might be mediated in part through elevated levels of circulating CXCL1.
28
In addition, CXCL1 may be equipotent to interleukin-8 with respect to eliciting neutrophil responses, such as chemotaxis and degranulation.
29
Apart from pro-inflammatory properties, CXCL1 has mitogenic and angiogenic effects that may modulate chronic inflammation.
30
Indeed, our observation that the serum concentration of CXCL1 in CD correlated well with CDAI may confirm this possibility. Together with the results of previous studies,
14,
31,
32
our results collectively suggest that CXCL1 may have an important role in the intestinal inflammation associated with CD and may serve as a useful biomarker of the disease. After the initial influx of PMN leukocytes, CC chemokines attract multiple leukocyte subsets such as monocytes, T lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils.
33
In RNA-seq analysis, CCL25 showed the highest fold change between IMCD and HC and between NMCD and HC (see Supplementary Material 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/
IBD/B473). However, CCL25 showed no significant difference between IMCD and NMCD.
Skip lesions are a characteristic phenotype of CD, appearing as an abrupt transition between unaffected normal-looking FIGURE 7. Immunohistochemistry for CXCL1 (A) and MMP12 (B). Immunohistochemical staining using CXCL1 antibodies and MMP12 antibodies revealed no expression in normal mucosa, slightly increased expression in noninflamed CD mucosa, and highly increased expression in inflamed CD mucosa. The staining intensity of CXCL1 was more pronounced than that of MMP12. mucosa and affected ulcerative mucosa. The distinct differences in the gene expression patterns of inflamed CD mucosa compared with controls are well established.
5,
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
However, there have been few microarray-based genome-wide expression analyses of unaffected normal-looking CD mucosa compared with normal mucosa of HC.
34,
35
Furthermore, microarray results for the comparison of macroscopically normal CD mucosa and normal tissue have been inconsistent; some gene expression studies have shown that normal-appearing colonic mucosa of uninvolved areas in UC tissues are molecularly comparable with controls,
35
whereas significant differences in gene expression have been reported in pediatric CD tissues relative to controls.
34,
36
The present study analyzed the gene expression of noninflamed mucosa using RNA-seq. In the principal component analysis and correlation analyses, the gene expression profiles of HC or IMCD samples were relatively homogeneous and clustered, whereas those of NMCD samples were heterogeneous and scattered between the HC and IMCD samples. This may be explained by the fact that NMCD had inflammation that was not apparent macroscopically or was in a primed state.
Further study is needed to identify which gene expression profiles of NMCD were closer to those of IMCD and which gene expression profiles of NMCD were closer to those of HCs.
Our study has strengths and also some limitations. Because of the relatively high cost of RNA-seq and the difficulty in obtaining fresh human intestinal samples from CD patients, the sample size was small. Concerns that the RNA quality of small specimens obtained from endoscopy may influence the outcomes of RNA-seq exist. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa and submucosa increased in the IMCD samples and decreased in the HC samples. Gene expression profiles are different in each inflammatory cell type, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages.
37
The number and types of inflammatory cells were different in the biopsy samples taken from HC, NMCD, and IMCD patients, which may have resulted in the differential expression patterns obtained by RNA-seq. The infiltration of inflammatory cells with pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine production is a key process in the intestinal inflammation of CD, rather than a particular feature of CD pathogenesis. In this analysis, all NMCD samples and HC samples were obtained from macroscopically normal-looking colonic mucosa. However, 6 IMCD samples were obtained from ileal mucosa (Montreal classification: L1 type), and 7 IMCD samples were obtained from colonic mucosa (Montreal classification: L2 and L3 types). Ileal and colonic tissues are biologically different under both normal and inflammatory conditions. The IMCD samples consisted of ileal and colonic tissues, resulting in concerns about heterogeneity. However, a pairwise correlation analysis of gene expression between groups explores the linear relationship between 2 variables. The pairwise correlation analysis between L1 cases and L2/L3 cases showed high concordance (IMCD of L1 versus L2/L3, Pearson's coefficient ¼ 0.93; Fig.
2
). Endoscopically, the IMCD mucosa was ulcerated, and there was no normal mucosa present in the ileum or colon. Furthermore, we performed DEG analysis of the IMCD samples, which included both ileal and colonic mucosa tissues. To address concerns about differential gene expression between the ileum and colon, DEG analysis was performed using only colonic mucosa samples, and CXCL1 exhibited the highest fold change between groups. Our aim was to identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts in the inflamed and noninflamed intestinal mucosa of CD patients, in the hopes that these transcripts will eventually be used as biomarkers of CD.
Our samples included untreated and treated patients, resulting in concerns about heterogeneity. To evaluate the effect of IBD medication, DEG analysis was performed in patients without medication (IMCD, n ¼ 9; NMCD, n ¼ 9; and HC, n ¼ 13). Twelve DEGs were common between asymptomatic (HC and NMCD) patients without medication and symptomatic (IMCD) patients without medication (see Supplementary Material 9, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B473
). CXCL1 exhibited a high fold change between groups and has been proposed to have a functional association with CD. Among the upregulated genes, the mean of normalized counts for CXCL1 was the highest. However, AQP9 and S1000A8 showed more prominent fold changes compared with CXCL1. A previous study reported that AQP9 expression in peripheral blood is useful for discriminating between chronic inflammatory conditions and HC.
38
S1000A8 is one of the components of calprotectin and was identified as an inflammatory mediator in patients with CD unresponsive to antitumor necrosis factor a therapy.
14
This study demonstrated transcriptomic differences between IMCD, NMCD, and HC. The intestinal inflammation of CD is characterized by a continuous influx of inflammatory cells into the gut wall.
39
CXCL1 is expressed by PMN leukocytes during progression of inflammation. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR identified that IMCD showed the highest expression level of CXCL1 and NMCD showed a lower, but still significant, expression level of CXCL1. This result suggests that the progressive expression of CXCL1 reflects the progression of inflammation in CD, although time- dependent changes were not the focus of these studies. The identification of transcripts for which expression levels increase sequentially with the progression of inflammation in CD may provide significant insight into pathobiological processes of tissue damage in CD and can be used as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. In addition, the gene expression pattern of the noninflamed mucosa was quite heterogeneous and was scattered between the normal mucosa and inflamed mucosa. This implied that the noninflamed mucosa in some CD patients either had significant inflammation that was not apparent macroscopically or was in a primed state. Therefore, a large-scale genome-wide transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq in adult CD patients is needed.
