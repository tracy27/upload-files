Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to compare the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component.

**Data Component:**
Looking at the Ground Truth (GT) data, there are six entries. The predicted data has three entries. Let me check each one.

- **data_1**: Both mention Transcriptomics, GEO source, and public_id GSE163574. The predicted adds a link and format 'txt', which isn't in GT but isn't wrong. Since the main info matches, this is accurate and complete here. But GT has more data entries, so completeness might be an issue.

- **data_2 & data_3**: Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics with correct public IDs and sources (ProteomeXchange). Predicted adds links and formats like 'raw'. Again, the core info matches GT's PXD numbers and sources. So these are accurate but again, only 3 out of 6 data entries in GT are covered. The others in GT (data_4,5,6) are missing in the prediction. 

So for Data:
- Structure: The JSON looks valid in both. Each entry has required keys, though GT has empty fields which might be okay. The prediction includes extra fields like 'link' and 'format', but that's allowed as long as structure is maintained. So Structure score should be high, maybe 100?
- Accuracy: The existing entries match the GT where they exist. The extra details like links don't conflict, so accuracy is good. Maybe deduct a bit for adding extra fields not in GT? But the main data points are correct. So Accuracy around 80%? 
- Completeness: Only 3 out of 6 data entries are present. That’s half, so 50%. But wait, some GT data have omics as empty. Let me check GT data_4 to 6:

GT data_4: omics is empty, source TCGA, public_id TCGA_PAAD, format matrix.
data_5: source ICGC_AU, public_id ICGC_AU.
data_6: source GEO (same as data_1?), public_id GSE62452, format matrix.

The prediction doesn’t include these. So missing three entries. Hence, completeness is low. So maybe 50% for accuracy (since existing entries are right) and completeness 50% (3/6). Wait, but maybe the prediction didn't miss them because they aren't present. So total completeness would be 3/6 = 50%, so completeness score 50. 

Overall Data score: Maybe (Accuracy 80 + Completeness 50)/2? But according to the instructions, the final score is based on overall proportion. So overall similarity between predicted and GT data: the predicted has 3 correct out of 6, plus possible some inaccuracies in formatting. Let me think: since 50% of the data entries are present and correct, but maybe the extra fields in prediction (like links) are irrelevant, so the total similarity is about 50%? But the existing entries are accurate, so maybe 60? Hmm. The user says penalize for missing or extra. The missing ones are 3, so penalty for those. The extras (the added fields) might not count against completeness but structure? No, structure is about validity. So maybe the overall Data component is around 50% (completeness) plus accuracy at 80, but the final score is the global similarity. Since the predicted has 50% of the data entries correct (assuming the three it has are accurate), then maybe 50%? Or since the three entries are accurate but missing others, the total similarity is 50%? So Data score: ~50?

Wait, the user says "global similarity scoring for each component based on overall proportion of similar content". So comparing all elements. The predicted has 3 data entries, GT has 6. Of those 3, they are accurate. The other 3 in GT are missing. So the overlap is 3/6 = 50% of GT covered. Additionally, the predicted has no extra data beyond the three, so no penalty for extra. Therefore, completeness is 50%. Accuracy on those three is 100%? Because the three entries in prediction are exactly matching GT's data except for additional fields like links and formats, which may not affect accuracy as per the note: "Fields such as data_id or analysis_id are unique identifiers only. Do not penalize mismatched IDs if the content is otherwise correct." Wait, but the format and links are extra fields. Are those considered part of the accuracy? The GT has empty strings for some fields. The predicted filled them in. Since the instructions say to judge accuracy based on semantic equivalence, not exact phrasing. So if the added fields (like link and format) are extra but correct, does that matter? The problem says to not penalize for extra? Or is the requirement that the key-value pairs must match GT's structure? Wait, the structure aspect checks if the component is valid JSON and proper key-value. The prediction's data entries have more keys than GT, but that's allowed as long as they form valid JSON. So structure is okay. However, the accuracy requires that the predicted's content matches GT. Since GT's data entries have some empty fields (like format for data_1 in GT is empty, but predicted put 'txt'), does that matter? The instruction says accuracy is semantic equivalence. If the format being 'txt' is actually correct (maybe the data is stored in text files), but GT didn't specify, then maybe it's acceptable. Since the user says not to penalize for extra info unless it's incorrect. Since the format is a detail not present in GT, but not conflicting, perhaps it's okay. So the three data entries are accurate. Thus, the accuracy is 100% for those present, but completeness is 50% (3/6). The global similarity would thus be around 50% because half the data is covered. So Data score: 50.

**Analyses Component:**

GT analyses have 13 entries (analysis_1 to analysis_13). The predicted has 9 (analysis_1 to analysis_9).

Let me map them:

GT analyses:
1. Transcriptomics Analysis (data_1)
2. Proteomics Analysis (data_2)
3. Phosphoproteomics Analysis (data_3)
4. LASSO Cox (data4,6)
5. Survival analysis (training data4, test data5,6)
6. Diff expr analysis (analysis1)
7. Pathway analysis (analysis6)
8. Diff expr (analysis2)
9. Pathway (analysis8)
10. Diff expr (analysis3)
11. Pathway (analysis10)
12. univariate Cox (data4)
13. Pathway (analysis12)

Predicted analyses:
1. Transcriptomics (data1)
2. Differential analysis (data1)
3. Pathway analysis (analysis2)
4. Proteomics (data2)
5. Phosphoproteomics (data3)
6. Integrated multi-omics (analysis2,4,5)
7. Classification (analysis6 plus data4,5,6)
8. Regression (analysis7)
9. Biomarker (analysis6 and data4,5,6)

Hmm. Need to see overlaps.

First, structure: each analysis in predicted has 'id', 'analysis_name', 'analysis_data', and sometimes 'label'. GT's analyses also have 'id', 'analysis_name', 'analysis_data' (and for some, training/test sets). The structure in predicted seems valid JSON, so structure score 100.

Accuracy:

Starting with analysis_1 in both: GT's is "Transcriptomics Analysis" linked to data1. Prediction's is "Transcriptomics" with data1. Semantically equivalent, so accurate.

Analysis_2 in GT is "Differential expression analysis" (analysis1). Prediction has "Differential analysis" linked to data1 directly. Wait, GT's analysis2's analysis_data is ["analysis_1"], while predicted's analysis2's analysis_data is ["data_1"]. That's a discrepancy. In GT, analysis2 is built on analysis1, but predicted skips that step and uses data directly. So that's inaccurate.

Similarly, analysis_3 in GT is pathway analysis from analysis6 (which is from analysis2's diff expr). Predicted analysis3 is pathway from analysis2 (differential analysis). So the chain is slightly off but related.

Analysis_4 in GT is Proteomics Analysis on data2. Predicted's analysis4 is "Proteomics" with data2. Same as GT, so accurate.

Analysis_5 in GT is Phosphoproteomics Analysis on data3. Predicted's analysis5 is "Phosphoproteomics" with data3. Also accurate.

Analysis_6 in GT is Diff expr analysis (analysis3). Predicted doesn't have that, but their analysis6 is integrated multi-omics combining analysis2,4,5. Not sure if that aligns.

Analysis_7 in GT is pathway analysis from analysis6 (diff expr on transcriptomics). Predicted analysis3 is pathway from differential analysis (directly on data). Not exactly the same path.

The GT's analysis4 (LASSO Cox using data4 and 6) is not present in predicted. Instead, predicted has analysis7 (classification using analysis6 plus data4,5,6). So that's a different approach but might relate to survival or LASSO? Not sure.

GT's analysis5 (survival analysis with training data4 and test data5,6) is not present in predicted. The closest is analysis7's classification with data4-6, but the method is different (LASSO Cox vs classification?).

GT's analysis12 (univariate Cox on data4) and analysis13 (pathway from that) are missing in predicted.

GT's analysis6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 are either missing or differently structured in predicted.

So accuracy: The first few analyses (1,4,5) are accurate. Analysis2 in predicted is mislinked (using data instead of analysis). Analysis3 is somewhat correct but based on different prior analysis. The rest (from analysis6 onwards in GT) are either missing or not matched.

Out of 13 GT analyses, maybe 3-4 are accurate (analysis1,4,5; possibly analysis3 if considered pathway analysis even if path differs). The rest are missing or incorrect. So accuracy could be 25-30%.

Completeness: The predicted has 9 analyses. Of those, maybe 3-4 are accurate, but GT has 13. So the overlap is about 3/13 ≈23%, but maybe some others partially align. But many are missing. So completeness is low, maybe 20-25%.

Global similarity would be around 25% (since most are missing and some inaccuracies). But maybe higher if considering some partial matches. Alternatively, if the main analyses like the integrated ones are considered, but the structure is different. It's tricky. Alternatively, if 3 accurate out of 13 GT, plus some others are present but inaccurate, but the majority are missing. So overall similarity ~20-25%. Maybe giving a 25% score here.

But wait, let me check again. The predicted has analysis7 (integrated) and analysis9 (biomarker) which might correspond to GT's analysis4 (LASSO Cox) and analysis9 (pathway from biomarker? Not sure). But not exact. So maybe 3 correct (analysis1,4,5), plus a couple partial. Let's say 4 out of 13, so ~30% accuracy, and completeness similarly. So maybe 30% total? Or lower. Perhaps the accuracy is 30% and completeness 25%, leading to around 25-30% total. Maybe 25%.

**Results Component:**

GT results have 5 entries. Predicted has 9.

GT results are linked to analyses 4,5,6,9,11. The features and metrics vary.

Predicted results are linked to analysis1-9. 

Checking each:

Result1 (GT analysis4): Features are TOP2A etc. In predicted, analysis9 has features including those, but also mentions "may act as...". The core features match, so that's accurate. But the analysis_id differs (GT4 vs predicted9). However, the analysis itself (LASSO Cox in GT4) might correspond to predicted's analysis7 (classification via LASSO Cox?). If analysis7 is the LASSO Cox, then the result for analysis7 in predicted (analysis7's result has features like TOP2A) would align with GT's analysis4. However, in predicted's results, analysis9 (biomarker) has those features. So maybe a misalignment in analysis linking, but the features are correct. So that's a partial accuracy.

Result2 (GT analysis5): Metrics AUC with values [0.87,0.65]. In predicted, analysis9's AUC values include those numbers (0.87 and 0.65 for specific cohorts). So that's accurate but under a different analysis ID. So the data is there but linked to wrong analysis? That reduces accuracy.

Result3 (GT analysis6): Features are various pathways. Predicted's analysis3 has "24 pathways" and lists some, which might include some from GT. So partial match.

Result4 (GT analysis9): Features like rRNA, lysosome etc. In predicted, analysis4's result has "Ribosome, Lysosome" which matches. But analysis4 in GT is pathway from analysis8, which is proteomics' diff expr. So the predicted's analysis4 (proteomics analysis) might not have a result, but the features in result4 (analysis4) in predicted might not align.

This is getting complex. Let me list each GT result and see:

GT Result 1 (analysis4):
- Features: TOP2A etc. 
Predicted has analysis9's result with those features. So if analysis9 in predicted corresponds to analysis4 in GT (since analysis9's biomarker uses analysis6 and data4-6, which might involve LASSO Cox), then this is accurate but linked to wrong analysis. However, the features are correct. So accuracy here is okay.

GT Result2 (analysis5):
- AUC values. Predicted analysis9 includes those, so again correct but linked to different analysis.

GT Result3 (analysis6):
- Pathways listed. Predicted's analysis3's result includes some of these (like p53, cell cycle), so partial match.

GT Result4 (analysis9):
- Features: rRNA, LAMP proteins etc. In predicted, analysis4's result (proteomics analysis) has Ribosome and Lysosome, which match. So that's accurate for analysis4's result? But GT's analysis9 is pathway from analysis8 (proteomics' pathway). So maybe alignment is okay.

GT Result5 (analysis11):
- Pathways like RNA transport, spliceosome etc. Predicted's analysis5's result (phosphoproteomics analysis) has "RNA transport", "spliceosome", so partial match.

Additionally, predicted has more results (like analysis1's IC50, analysis2's DEGs count, etc.) which GT doesn't have. These are extra and penalized for completeness.

Accuracy assessment: For each GT result, see if it's present in predicted with correct features/metrics.

- Result1 (analysis4's features): Found in analysis9's result in predicted. The features match, so accurate despite wrong analysis linkage. But since the analysis_id is different, maybe considered inaccurate? Or does the content matter? Since the question says semantic equivalence. If the biomarker result (analysis9 in pred) includes the correct features from LASSO Cox (which was analysis4 in GT), then it's accurate. The analysis linkage might be an error in the predicted's structure, but the content is correct. So accuracy here is okay.

- Result2 (analysis5's AUC): Present in analysis9's result, so accurate.

- Result3 (analysis6's pathways): Partial match in analysis3's result (some pathways listed).

- Result4 (analysis9's features): Matched in analysis4's result.

- Result5 (analysis11's pathways): Partial in analysis5's result.

So maybe 4 out of 5 GT results have accurate content, albeit linked to wrong analyses. That's 80% accuracy on existing, but also there are extra results in predicted (analysis1's IC50 etc.), which penalize completeness.

Completeness: GT has 5 results. Predicted has 9. Out of the 5 GT, how many are covered? All 5 have counterparts in predicted but with some mismatches. So maybe 5/5 accurate content-wise (if we ignore analysis linkage), but analysis linkage is part of the accuracy? The analysis_id in results is crucial because it ties to the analysis done. If the analysis_id is wrong, then it's incorrect. For example, GT's result1 is tied to analysis4 (LASSO Cox), but in predicted it's tied to analysis9 (biomarker). If the biomarker analysis indeed used the LASSO Cox results, then maybe that's okay. But if the analysis9 is a different analysis, then it's wrong. Since the analysis names differ (analysis9 in pred is "Biomarker identification" which might use the LASSO Cox outputs, then perhaps it's acceptable. So the analysis linkage might still be accurate in content terms. 

Assuming the analysis linkage is correct in content (even if ID differs), then accuracy could be high. However, the IDs must correspond. Since the analysis IDs are unique identifiers, if they don't match, that's an error. For instance, GT's result1 is from analysis4 (LASSO Cox), but predicted's result for that is analysis9 (Biomarker), which is a different analysis. Even if the content is correct, the linkage is wrong, making it inaccurate. That's a problem.

In that case:

- Result1: analysis linkage wrong (4→9) → inaccurate
- Result2: analysis5→9 → inaccurate
- Result3: analysis6→3 → inaccurate (analysis3 is pathway from diff expr)
- Result4: analysis9→4 → inaccurate (analysis4 is proteomics analysis)
- Result5: analysis11→5 (phospho analysis) → maybe analysis5's result in pred is phospho's analysis, so that's correct?

Wait analysis5 in predicted is "Phosphoproteomics" analysis (data3). Its result (analysis5) has features like RNA transport, which matches GT's analysis11 (phospho pathway). So analysis11 in GT is pathway from phospho's diff expr (analysis10), which is analysis5's result in predicted. That's a bit tangled. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Let me try a rough estimate. 

If the predicted results cover the main features but have wrong analysis links and extra entries, the accuracy might be around 60-70% (since some features are correct but some links wrong). Completeness: GT's 5 are mostly covered (except maybe one?), but predicted has extras, so completeness is maybe 80% (since 5 are present but with some inaccuracy). The global similarity would be around 60-70% considering both accuracy and completeness penalties for extras. 

Alternatively, if the analysis linkage is critical for accuracy, then the accuracy drops. Suppose 3 out of 5 GT results have correct analysis linkage and features. Then accuracy 60%, completeness 80% (since 5 out of 5 GT are addressed but with some extras). Overall ~70%? 

Alternatively, maybe the results are about 60% accurate and 70% complete, leading to ~65%.

Hmm. This is tough. Let me proceed with the scores.

**Final Scores:**
- Data: 50 (50% completeness, accuracy 80 → maybe average to 65? Wait the user says to base on global similarity. Since 50% of data entries are present and correct, the global similarity is 50%.)
- Analyses: 25 (due to many missing and inaccuracies)
- Results: 60 (assuming 60% similarity considering coverage and some inaccuracies)

But let me adjust again.

For Data:
- 3 correct entries out of 6 → 50% similarity. The extra fields don't penalize completeness, so 50.

Analyses:
- The predicted has 9 analyses vs GT's 13. Overlap in content is about 3-4 accurate ones. So similarity is roughly (3+4)/13 ≈ 5/13 ~38%, but maybe 25% due to structural differences.

Results:
- 5 GT results mostly covered with some inaccuracies and extras. Maybe 60% similarity (since 5/5 are addressed but with some errors, plus extras).

Thus, final scores:

Data: 50

Analyses: 25

Results: 60

But maybe Analyses can be a bit higher. If the first few analyses are accurate (analysis1,4,5), and some others partially, maybe 30%?

Alternatively, let me think again:

Analyses:
- The main analyses like transcriptomics, proteomics, phospho are present and accurate (analysis1,4,5). That's 3 correct. Then analysis3 (pathway) is somewhat okay. So 4/13 ~30% accurate. Plus some others might have partial matches. Maybe 30% total.

Thus:

Final Scores:
{
    "Data": 50,
    "Analyses": 30,
    "Results": 60
}

Wait, but the instructions say to score each component based on global similarity. So Data is 50%. Analyses might be 25% (if very few overlaps). Results could be around 60%.

Alternatively, maybe the results are better. Let me check again:

GT Results have 5 entries. In predicted, the following correspond:

1. GT Result1 (analysis4 features) → pred analysis9 has those features. So content matches but wrong analysis ID. If the analysis ID is part of the accuracy, then this is wrong. If not, then content is correct. Since the instructions say to consider the entire object's factual consistency, including analysis_id. The analysis_id must link correctly. So this is an error. Similarly for others. 

If all five GT results have incorrect analysis_ids in the predicted, but the content matches, then accuracy is 0 for those? Unlikely. Probably the analysis linkage is important. 

Suppose for each result, the analysis_id must match the GT's. Then:

- None of the predicted results have matching analysis_ids to GT. Because GT's analyses are numbered up to 13, while predicted uses up to 9 with different naming. 

Wait, in GT, the analysis4 is "LASSO Cox", which is part of the survival analysis maybe. In predicted, analysis7 is "Classification analysis using LASSO Cox". So perhaps analysis7 corresponds to GT's analysis4 and 5 (survival/LASSO). But the analysis_id is different.

This makes it hard to get perfect matches. 

Maybe the Results accuracy is 0 since analysis_ids don't match, but the content (features) do? Or is the analysis_id not critical as long as the content is correct? The instructions say "semantic equivalence, not exact phrasing". The analysis_id is just an identifier, so mismatched IDs are okay as per the note: "Do not penalize mismatched IDs if the content is otherwise correct."

Ah! Here's a key point: The note says not to penalize mismatched IDs. So the analysis_id in the results can differ from GT as long as the content (like the features and metrics) match the correct analysis. 

Therefore, even if the predicted's result has analysis9 linked to features from GT's analysis4, as long as the features/metrics match the correct analysis's output, it's okay. The analysis_id mismatch doesn't count against accuracy. 

That changes things. 

So for Results:

GT Result1 (analysis4's features) → predicted analysis9 has those features. Since the content is correct (features match), it's accurate despite analysis_id mismatch.

GT Result2 (analysis5's AUC) → predicted analysis9 has those values, so accurate.

GT Result3 (analysis6's pathways) → predicted analysis3 has some pathways, so partial match (maybe 50%).

GT Result4 (analysis9's features) → predicted analysis4's result has matching features (Ribosome, Lysosome), so accurate.

GT Result5 (analysis11's pathways) → predicted analysis5's result includes RNA transport and spliceosome, so accurate.

Thus, all 5 GT results are present in predicted with correct content (allowing for some partial matches). The extras in predicted (like analysis1's IC50) are extra entries, penalizing completeness. 

Completeness for Results: GT has 5, predicted has 9. The 5 GT are all covered (with possible partial matches), but there are 4 extra. So completeness is (5 / (5+4))? Or the formula is (correct items) / (total in GT + extra). Wait, the instructions say "penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects." 

Completeness is measured by how well the predicted covers GT, counting semantically equivalent as valid. Since all 5 GT results are covered (with analysis_id not affecting), completeness is 100% minus penalty for extras. But completeness is about covering GT, so if all 5 are there, completeness is 100%. The extras don't affect completeness but might affect accuracy if they're wrong, but the problem states to penalize completeness for extras. 

The instructions say "Count semantically equivalent objects as valid, even if the wording differs. Penalize for any missing objects or extra irrelevant objects."

So completeness is (number of GT objects correctly present) divided by total GT objects. Since all 5 are present (even if analysis_id differs but content is correct), completeness is 100%. The extras are penalized, but how? The instruction says to penalize for extra objects. The completeness score is reduced by the number of extra divided by total? 

Alternatively, completeness is about covering GT. Since all are covered, but there are extras, the completeness remains 100% but the extras count against accuracy? Or maybe completeness is capped at 100% but the presence of extras lowers the final score because of the penalty.

This is ambiguous. The user says to penalize for missing or extra. Since completeness is about how much of GT is covered, the extras don't reduce completeness but add a penalty. Maybe the completeness is 100% but the final score is adjusted down because of the extras. 

Alternatively, the completeness is calculated as (covered GT entries) / (covered GT + missing GT + extra entries). Not sure. The exact calculation isn't specified, but the instruction says "measure how well the predicted annotation covers relevant objects present in the ground truth." So extras don't affect completeness, only missing do. Thus completeness is 100% for Results. But the presence of extras would lower the accuracy because they're irrelevant? Or accuracy is about correctness of existing entries.

Accuracy for Results: All 5 GT entries are present with correct content (features/metrics), so accuracy is 100% for those. The extras are irrelevant, so they lower the overall accuracy. Since there are 9 entries in predicted, 5 are correct, 4 are extra. So accuracy is 5/9 ≈55.5%? Or since accuracy is about how accurate the predictions are that are present. The correct ones are 5/9 → ~55%. 

Alternatively, the instructions say accuracy is "how accurately the predicted reflects GT". The extra entries are not part of GT, so they contribute to inaccuracy. So the accuracy would be (correct entries)/(total predicted entries) * 100 → 5/9≈55.5%. But also, the existing entries' accuracy: the 5 GT entries are all correctly captured (even with analysis_id mismatch), so those are 100% accurate. The extras are 0% accurate. So overall accuracy is (5*1 + 4*0)/9 ≈55.5%. 

So for Results:
- Accuracy: ~55%
- Completeness: 100% (all GT covered)
- Final score: global similarity would be higher, but considering the extras, maybe 60-70%? 

Alternatively, since accuracy is 55% and completeness 100%, the final score might be around 77%? But the global similarity considers the overall content. Since 5/9 are correct and match GT, but GT has 5, so the similarity is 5/5 (for GT) but with 4 extras. The global similarity would be the proportion of correct content over total. Maybe 5/(5+4)=55%? Or 5/9≈55%? 

This is confusing. Maybe the user expects that if all GT results are present (even with extra), then completeness is 100%, and accuracy is based on how accurate the existing entries are. Since the 5 are accurate (with analysis_id not penalized), their accuracy is 100%, but the extras reduce the overall score. The final score is likely around 70-80% for Results.

After reconsidering with the analysis_id not penalized, Results have high accuracy (content matches) but some extras. Let's say accuracy 80% (since some minor discrepancies?) and completeness 100%, leading to a final score of ~85% (average of 80 and 100). But the global similarity might be 80% because of the extras. 

Hmm, perhaps 80% for Results.

Updating the scores:

- Data: 50
- Analyses: 30
- Results: 80

But let me confirm:

For Analyses, maybe 25% since most are missing and some are incorrect. 

Final scores JSON:

{
    "Data": 50,
    "Analyses": 25,
    "Results": 80
}

Alternatively, maybe Analyses is 20%.

Wait another angle for Analyses: 

GT has 13 analyses. The predicted has 9. Let's see how many of the predicted's analyses have semantic equivalents in GT:

1. analysis1 (transcriptomics) → GT1 → correct
2. analysis2 (diff analysis on data1) → GT6 (diff expr on analysis1) → not exactly same (direct vs on analysis1), but close.
3. analysis3 (pathway from analysis2) → GT7 (pathway from analysis6 (which is diff expr of analysis1). So similar path but one step off.
4. analysis4 (proteomics) → GT2 → correct
5. analysis5 (phospho) → GT3 → correct
6. analysis6 (integrated multi-omics combining analysis2,4,5) → GT's analysis6,7,8,9 etc. might relate but not exactly.
7. analysis7 (classification using analysis6 and data4-6) → GT's analysis4 (LASSO Cox), analysis5 (survival), analysis12 (univariate Cox). This could be a combination but not exact.
8. analysis8 (regression) → GT's analysis12 (univariate Cox) or analysis5 (survival)
9. analysis9 (biomarker) → GT's analysis4/5/13?

Some of these have partial matches. If we count analysis2-3 as partially correct (they form a pathway from diff expr), that's 2 more. analysis6-9 might cover 2 more. Total maybe 6 correct out of 13? 6/13 ~46%. But considering inaccuracies, maybe 30% is fair.

Alright, I'll settle with these scores.
