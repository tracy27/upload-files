Okay, I need to evaluate the predicted annotation against the ground truth for each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Let's start with the Data component first.

**Data Component:**

First, check the structure. The ground truth's data entries have fields like id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. The predicted data also has these keys except some might be missing values. Wait, looking at the ground truth's data_14, it has "sourse" misspelled, but maybe that's a typo in the input. The user said to ignore ID mismatches, so focus on content. 

Looking at the predicted data: The structure seems okay; each entry has the required keys. But let me confirm:

Each object in predicted data has id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. So structure-wise, they match. So structure score is probably 100 unless there's an error. Wait, in the ground truth, data_14 has some missing fields like "sourse" (probably typo), but since structure is about validity, maybe it's still valid JSON. The predicted data doesn't have that, so maybe structure is fine. So structure is good for both, so 100 for structure?

Next, accuracy. Need to compare each entry's omics type, link, public_id etc. Ground truth has more entries (14) vs predicted (10). Let's see:

Ground truth Data entries:

1. GSE150825 (single-cell)
2. GSE150430 (single-cell)
3. GSE162025 (single-cell)
4. GSE68799 (bulk RNA)
5. GSE102349 (bulk RNA)
6. GSE53819 (bulk RNA)
7. GSE13597 (bulk RNA)
8. GSE118719 (bulk RNA)
9. GSE96538 (bulk RNA)
10. GSE139324 (single-cell)
11. GSE164690 (single-cell)
12. GSE200310 (spatial)
13. GSE200315 (single-cell, but format mentions Visium spatial? Wait no, the format field here says "raw and processed Visium..." but omics is single-cell. Hmm, maybe a mistake in ground truth?
14. ATAC-seq, but link/public_id empty.

Predicted Data:

Entries from data_1 to data_10:

data_1: GSE68799 (bulk RNA in GT) → omics in predicted is "Transcriptomics". Hmm, in GT data_4 is GSE68799 as bulk RNA. So predicted's data_1's omics is Transcriptomics vs GT's bulk RNA. Is that accurate? Well, bulk RNA sequencing is a type of transcriptomics, so maybe acceptable. But the term used in GT is "bulk RNA sequencing", while predicted uses "Transcriptomics" which is broader. Maybe acceptable as semantically equivalent? Not sure yet. Also, the link matches.

data_2: GSE102349 (GT's data_5 is this, same as above, "Transcriptomics" vs bulk RNA. Same issue.

data_3: GSE13597 (GT's data_7, same as above).

data_4: GSE53819 (GT's data_6 → same issue.

data_5: GSE150825 (GT's data_1 → single-cell, but predicted uses "Single-cell RNA Sequencing" which is correct. So that's accurate.

Similarly data_6,7,8 correspond to other single-cell entries in GT.

data_9: GSE200310 (GT's data_12 → spatial, predicted says "Spatial Transcriptomics" which is right.

data_10: GSE200315 (GT's data_13 → in GT, the omics is single-cell, but in predicted it's listed under "Single-cell RNA Sequencing", which is correct. However, in GT's data_13, the format mentions Visium, which is spatial, but omics is single-cell. Maybe a mistake in GT? Not sure, but predicted's entry is accurate for the omics type.

Now, checking coverage. The ground truth has 14 entries, but predicted only 10. Missing entries include data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_12 (spatial?), wait no: predicted does have data_9 as GSE200310 (which is data_12 in GT). Wait data_12 is GSE200310, which is covered by data_9 in predicted. Then data_13 in GT is GSE200315, which is predicted's data_10. So those are covered. The missing ones would be data_4 (GSE68799 is in predicted's data_1, but what about others?) Wait GT has data_8 (GSE118719), data_9 (GSE96538), data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_12 (already covered), data_13 (covered), and data_14 (ATAC-seq). So in predicted, data_8 and data_9 in GT are not present? Wait let me list all GT data entries:

GT Data entries:

data_1 (GSE150825) → covered in predicted data_5

data_2 (GSE150430) → ?

Wait predicted's data_6 is GSE150430 (GT's data_2?), yes. So data_2 is in predicted as data_6.

Similarly:

GT data_3 (GSE162025) → predicted data_7.

GT data_4 (GSE68799) → predicted data_1.

GT data_5 (GSE102349) → predicted data_2.

GT data_6 (GSE53819) → predicted data_4.

GT data_7 (GSE13597) → predicted data_3.

GT data_8 (GSE118719) → not in predicted's data entries. Because predicted has up to data_10, but data_8 in GT is GSE118719, which is not in predicted.

Similarly, GT data_9 (GSE96538) is not in predicted. So those two (data_8 and data_9 in GT) plus data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_14 (ATAC-seq) are missing in predicted. So total missing entries: 5 (data_8,9,10,11,14). Plus, the ATAC-seq data_14 in GT isn't present in predicted. Also, data_12 and 13 are covered. So predicted has 10 entries, GT has 14. That's a problem for completeness.

Also, the predicted has extra entries beyond the GT? No, because all their entries are from existing GT entries except maybe none. Wait, no. Their data entries are mapped to GT entries except the missing ones. So completeness: the predicted misses several entries. 

Accuracy-wise, for the entries present, most are accurate except for the omics terms like using "Transcriptomics" instead of "bulk RNA sequencing". Since "bulk RNA sequencing" is a type of transcriptomics, maybe acceptable? Or is it better to specify bulk? The ground truth uses specific terms, so maybe the predicted should use exactly that. If the user says semantic equivalence is okay, then "Transcriptomics" might be considered correct for bulk RNA, but perhaps not fully accurate. Alternatively, the term discrepancy might count against accuracy. For example, GT's data_4 is "bulk RNA sequencing", but predicted uses "Transcriptomics". Since the question allows semantic equivalence, maybe acceptable. But if "Transcriptomics" is broader, perhaps it's less precise. Hmm, this needs judgment.

Additionally, predicted's data_8 is GSE96538 (GT's data_8?), no: GT's data_8 is GSE118719. Wait confusion here. Let me recheck:

Predicted data entries:

data_1: GSE68799 (GT data_4)

data_2: GSE102349 (GT data_5)

data_3: GSE13597 (GT data_7)

data_4: GSE53819 (GT data_6)

data_5: GSE150825 (GT data_1)

data_6: GSE150430 (GT data_2)

data_7: GSE162025 (GT data_3)

data_8: GSE96538 (GT's data_9)

Wait GT's data_9 is GSE96538 (bulk RNA). So that's covered in predicted as data_8. So actually, GT data_9 is included in predicted's data_8. Then where is GT's data_8 (GSE118719)? It's missing. Similarly, GT data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_14 (ATAC-seq) are missing.

So missing entries are data_8 (GSE118719), data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_14 (ATAC-seq). So four missing entries plus data_12 and 13 are covered, data_9 (GSE96538) is in predicted data_8. Wait that's five missing? Let me recount:

GT data entries 1-14:

Missing in predicted are data_8 (GSE118719), data_10 (GSE139324), data_11 (GSE164690), data_14 (ATAC-seq). That's four. Data_9 (GSE96538) is in predicted's data_8, so that's covered. So total missing is 4.

Plus, the ATAC-seq (data_14) is missing, which is significant because it's a separate omics type. So completeness is low because they missed several entries. 

For accuracy, the omics terms: for the bulk RNA entries (GT's data_4 to 9 except data_9?), the predicted uses "Transcriptomics" which may be acceptable. Let's say half of the bulk entries are mislabeled. There are 6 bulk entries in GT (data4-9?), but some are missing. For the ones present (data_4-7 in GT), the predicted uses "Transcriptomics". So accuracy penalty here.

Structure is okay, so structure score 100.

Accuracy: Maybe around 70%? Because some entries have term discrepancies, but most are there. But missing entries affect completeness more.

Completeness: The predicted has 10 out of 14, so ~71%, but considering the missing important entries like ATAC-seq, maybe lower. Let's see: 10/14 is ~71, but maybe the ATAC is critical. So completeness score maybe around 60-70%.

Overall for Data component, combining accuracy and completeness, maybe around 70? Let me think again.

Wait the global similarity is the main criteria. The total number of entries: 14 vs 10. The overlap is 10 entries (since predicted includes 10, but some are from GT's entries). The missing 4 are non-overlapping. So overlapping entries are 10, but some have accuracy issues. 

Alternatively, maybe the accurate entries are mostly correct except terms. So for accuracy per entry:

Of the 10 entries in predicted:

- 5 are bulk RNA (data_1,2,3,4,8?), but labeled as Transcriptomics. If that's considered accurate, then accuracy is good. The single-cell entries (data5-7, etc.) are correctly labeled. The spatial one (data9) is correct.

The ATAC-seq is missing. So maybe the accuracy part (excluding completeness) is high, but completeness is lower. 

Perhaps the accuracy (correctness of existing entries) is 80% (if term issues are minor), and completeness is 70% (10/14). So overall data score could be (80 + 70)/2 = 75, but maybe weighted differently. Alternatively, since the user says to consider global similarity, which is the overall proportion of similar content. 

If the predicted has 10 entries, and the GT has 14, with 10 matching (assuming all except the missing ones are accurate), then 10/14 ≈71%. But some of those 10 may have inaccuracies. Suppose 2 out of 10 have term issues (like the bulk RNA vs transcriptomics), then maybe ~90% accuracy on existing entries. So total similarity might be 71 * 0.9 ≈ ~64%? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 70% for data.

Moving to Analyses:

**Analyses Component:**

Ground truth analyses have 15 entries. Predicted has 11 analyses. Need to check structure, accuracy, completeness.

Structure: Check if each analysis entry has valid JSON. Looking at predicted analyses, they have id, analysis_name, analysis_data, sometimes label. The ground truth has similar structure except some have additional fields like analysis_data being arrays, labels, etc. The predicted's structure seems okay. So structure score 100.

Accuracy: Need to see if the analysis names and data links match.

Ground truth analyses:

analysis_1: Single cell Transcriptomics on data1-3 (GT data_1,2,3)

analysis_2: Single cell Clustering on analysis_1

analysis_3: Spatial on data12 (GSE200310)

analysis_4: Transcriptomics on data4-8 (bulk RNA)

analysis_5: Differential on analysis4

analysis_6: Survival on analysis5, stratified...

analysis_7: Transcriptomics on data9 (GSE96538)

analysis_8: SCT on data10 (GSE139324)

analysis_9: Clustering on analysis8

analysis_10:SCT on data11 (GSE164690)

analysis_11:Clustering on analysis10

analysis_12:SCT on data13 (GSE200315)

analysis_13:Clustering on analysis12

analysis_14:Enrichment on analysis13

analysis_15:ATAC-seq on data14

Predicted analyses:

analysis1: SCT (name: "Single-cell RNA Sequencing") on data5-8 (which map to GT data1,2,3, etc.? Let's see: data5 in predicted is GT data1 (GSE150825), data6 is GT data2, etc. So analysis1's data are the single-cell datasets, so that's correct.

Analysis2: Bulk RNA analysis on data1-4 (GT data4-7?), which are bulk RNA datasets. So analysis2 is correct.

Analysis3: Spatial on data9 (GSE200310) → correct.

Analysis4: Cell-Cell interaction on data5-7 (GT's data1-3?), but in GT analysis4 is on bulk RNA. So this is different. So analysis4 in predicted is incorrect in its purpose (cell-cell vs transcriptomics).

Analysis5: Lipid metabolism, which isn't in GT.

Analysis6: ATAC-seq on data5-6 (GT data1's data are single-cell, but ATAC requires data14 which is missing in predicted). So analysis6 is wrong.

Others like analysis7-11 involve other experiments not in GT (co-culture, organoid, etc.), which are extra.

So accuracy is problematic here. Many analyses in predicted don't match the GT's analyses. Only a few (analysis1,2,3) are correct.

Completeness: GT has 15, predicted has 11. But many are incorrect. The correct ones (analysis1,2,3) plus maybe analysis7? Wait analysis7 in predicted is Co-Culture Experiments which isn't in GT. So only 3 correct analyses out of 15? That's bad. So accuracy is low.

Wait analysis4 in GT is Transcriptomics on bulk data, which is analysis2 in predicted (Bulk RNA). So analysis2 might be accurate. Analysis1 is SCT on single-cell, which matches GT's analysis1. Analysis3 matches GT analysis3. So that's 3 accurate analyses. The rest are either incorrect or extra. So accuracy is 3/15≈20%? But structure is okay.

Completeness: The predicted has 11 analyses but many are incorrect. The correct ones are 3, so completeness is 3/15≈20%, but since some are extra, maybe even worse. So overall, analyses score might be very low, like 30 or lower.

**Results Component:**

Ground truth results have entries linked to analyses, metrics, features.

Predicted results have 11 entries linked to analyses 1-11, each with metrics and features. Need to check if the analyses mentioned exist in the predicted's analyses and if the metrics/features align with ground truth.

Ground truth results are not provided in the query. Wait wait, the ground truth's results section wasn't included in the user's message. Wait looking back:

Wait the user provided the ground truth's data, analyses, but the results section in the ground truth? The initial message shows the ground truth includes "results", but in the actual data provided by the user, the ground truth's results section is missing? Let me check:

In the user's input, the ground truth JSON ends with "analyses": [...] }, but the user's input shows that after "analyses", there is a closing } but maybe the results were not included? Wait looking at the user's input:

The ground truth provided by the user ends with "...", so maybe the results section was omitted. Wait the user wrote:

Ground truth:
{
    "article_id": ...,
    "data": [...],
    "analyses": [...],
    "results": [ ... ] ??

Wait no, in the user's input, the ground truth's JSON is written out, but when I look at the pasted data, the ground truth ends at the analyses section. Let me check:

Looking back at the user's input:

Under Ground truth, after the analyses array, it ends with a closing brace. The user's input for ground truth's analyses ends with "analysis_15": ATAC, then the entire JSON closes. So the ground truth's results section is NOT provided. Wait that can't be right. Wait the user's input shows:

The ground truth has "data", "analyses", but the results are missing. Wait in the initial prompt, the user provided the ground truth's data and analyses but not the results. However, the predicted annotation includes a results section. This is a problem because without the ground truth's results, I can't evaluate the predicted results. Did I miss something?

Wait checking again the user's input:

Looking at the user's message, under "Ground truth:" the JSON provided includes "data", "analyses", but the "results" section is missing. The predicted annotation has a "results" section, but there's no ground truth results to compare against. This is a critical omission. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the Results component properly. However, the user might have intended that the ground truth does NOT include results, or perhaps it was an error.

Wait the user's task says "You will be given 1. The ground truth annotation of a multiomics research paper. 2. A predicted annotation of the same paper." The ground truth's JSON in the user's input does not include the results section. So perhaps the ground truth's results are empty or not provided. In that case, evaluating the results component is impossible. But the user expects a score for Results, so maybe I made a mistake in parsing.

Wait looking again at the user's input:

The ground truth's JSON as pasted by the user ends with the analyses section. The analyses array ends with "analysis_15", then the closing brackets. There is no "results" key in the ground truth's JSON. The predicted annotation does have a "results" section, but without a ground truth, we can't score it. This is a problem.

Assuming that perhaps the ground truth's results were accidentally omitted, but given the instructions, I must proceed with what's provided. Since the ground truth lacks the results, I can't assess the predicted results. However, the user's task requires scoring all three components. This suggests an error in the provided data, but I'll have to handle it.

Possibly, the user made a mistake in omitting the ground truth's results, but since I can't proceed, I'll note that the results component cannot be evaluated due to missing ground truth data, hence assigning zero or NA. But the problem specifies to output scores for all three, so perhaps the ground truth results were present but I overlooked them.

Wait rechecking the user's input for the ground truth:

Looking at the user's message, after the "analyses" array, the JSON is closed with a closing brace. There is no "results" section in the ground truth. Thus, the ground truth does not include results. The predicted does, but since there's nothing to compare to, the results score would be 0 (or maybe structure is valid, but accuracy and completeness can't be assessed). Since the instructions say to base on the ground truth, which lacks results, the predicted's results are irrelevant, so maybe the results component gets a zero score. But the user might expect us to assume that the ground truth has no results, so predicted having results is extra, hence completeness is 0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ground truth does have results but it's missing here. Given ambiguity, I'll proceed by assuming that the ground truth's results are not provided, so the predicted's results cannot be scored, leading to 0. But the user might have intended the ground truth to have results. Alternatively, perhaps I missed them. Let me re-express the ground truth's JSON structure as presented:

The ground truth's JSON as provided by the user ends with:

... "analysis_15", "analysis_name": "ATAC-seq", "analysis_data": ["data_14"}
    ]
}
}

Wait no, the last line of the ground truth is:

        {
            "id": "analysis_14",
            "analysis_name": "Functional Enrichment Analysis",
            "analysis_data": ["analysis_13"]
        },
        {"id": "analysis_15", "analysis_name": "ATAC-seq", "analysis_data": ["data_14"]}
    ]
}

So the analyses array is closed with ], then the whole object is closed with }, so the ground truth does not include results. Hence, the results component in the predicted is entirely extra and not part of the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted results are completely incorrect (since they shouldn't exist), so the results score would be 0 for completeness (all entries are extra) and accuracy 0, leading to a final score of 0.

But this is a bit harsh. Alternatively, maybe the ground truth's results were supposed to be included but were cut off. Given the user's instructions require evaluating all three components, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the ground truth's results are empty, so the predicted results have no correct entries (completeness 0) and any entries are extra, so accuracy 0, thus 0 score.

Proceeding with that:

**Results Score: 0**

Now compiling all components:

Data:

- Structure: 100 (valid JSON)
- Accuracy: For existing entries, most are accurate except some term differences (Transcriptomics vs bulk RNA). Let's say 80% accuracy on existing entries (10 entries, 8 accurate)
- Completeness: 10/14 ≈71%, so maybe 70% due to missing entries and term issues. So overall ~75% (average of accuracy and completeness?)

Wait according to the scoring criteria, the final score is based on global similarity (proportion of similar content). So for Data component:

Total entries in GT:14. Predicted has 10, of which some are correct, some have minor issues.

The missing entries are 4 (including ATAC), plus the ATAC is a separate omics type.

The accurate entries are:

- All single-cell entries (GT data1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13) → but predicted includes most except some. Let me count:

Predicted data entries cover:

GT data1 (yes), data2 (yes via data6), data3 (via data7), data4 (via data1), data5 (via data2?), no, wait data_5 in predicted is GSE150825 (GT data1). data_4 in predicted is GSE53819 (GT data6). 

The bulk RNA entries in GT (data4-9 except data9 is covered) but data8 (GSE118719) is missing, and data9 is present (as predicted data8). So of the bulk RNA entries (GT data4-9), predicted includes data4 (GSE68799), data5 (GSE102349), data6 (GSE53819), data7 (GSE13597), and data9 (GSE96538). So that's 5 out of 6 bulk entries (missing data8: GSE118719). Plus the single-cell entries (data1-3,5-7, etc.) are covered except data10-11 and 13 (wait data13 is covered as data10). 

The total accurate entries would be 10 (predicted entries) minus any inaccuracies. The omics terms for bulk RNA being called "Transcriptomics" might reduce accuracy slightly. If each of the 5 bulk entries in predicted have that term discrepancy, that's 5 points lost (assuming 20% penalty per entry). So accuracy per entry: maybe 80% for each. So 5 entries with 80% accuracy contribute to lower overall.

Overall, the similarity might be around 70% (so 70 out of 100). 

Analyses:

Structure: 100 (valid JSON).

Accuracy: Only 3 accurate analyses (analysis1,2,3) out of 15 possible. But predicted has 11 analyses. So accurate analyses are 3, but others are either wrong or extra. 

Completeness: The GT has 15 analyses. The predicted has 11, but only 3 are correct. So completeness is 3/15 = 20%. But since they added extra, maybe completeness is penalized further. 

Global similarity would be the proportion of correct content. So 3 correct analyses out of 15 GT, plus some parts of others? Maybe 20% for accuracy, 20% for completeness → average 20% → but perhaps 30% overall?

Alternatively, the presence of extra analyses lowers completeness. The total analyses in predicted are 11, of which 3 are correct. So the correct portion is 3/(15+11)? Not sure. The global similarity is between predicted and GT. So the correct analyses are 3, GT has 15. So 3/15=20% accurate. Hence analyses score ~20-30.

Results:

0 as explained.

Final scores:

Data: ~70

Analyses: ~25

Results: 0

But need to compute precisely.

Recomputing Data:

Total entries in GT:14.

Predicted has 10 entries. Of those 10, how many are accurate?

Each entry:

data1 (GT data4): omics "Transcriptomics" vs "bulk RNA sequencing" → acceptable? If yes, then accurate.

data2 (GT data5): same as above.

data3 (GT data7): same.

data4 (GT data6): same.

data5 (GT data1): accurate (single-cell RNA seq).

data6 (GT data2): accurate.

data7 (GT data3): accurate.

data8 (GT data9): accurate (bulk RNA as Transcriptomics?).

data9 (GT data12): accurate (spatial).

data10 (GT data13): accurate (single-cell).

So all 10 entries are accurate except the omics terms for bulk entries. Are "Transcriptomics" vs "bulk RNA sequencing" considered semantically equivalent? Since bulk RNA is a subset of transcriptomics, maybe yes. So all 10 entries are accurate in terms of omics type. Thus accuracy is 100% for existing entries.

Completeness: 10/14 = ~71%. So Data score would be 71% + some adjustment for missing entries (the 4 missing). Since completeness is 71%, and accuracy 100% (except maybe format fields which are optional?), maybe the Data score is around 80? Or the missing entries reduce it. Since completeness is 71, and accuracy 100, average 85.5? But the missing entries include ATAC-seq which is a distinct omics type. So maybe subtract a portion for missing ATAC. The ATAC is one entry, so 1/14 (~7%) missing. So completeness is 10/14 ≈71, plus missing ATAC is another deduction. So maybe 60-70.

Alternatively, the user's criteria says to penalize for missing objects. The ATAC is missing, so that's a significant loss. The total missing is 4 entries (including ATAC). So 14-10=4 missing, so 4/14=28.5% penalty. So completeness score is 100-28.5=71.5. So Data score could be around 70-75.

Analyses:

Correct analyses: 3 (analysis1,2,3). The rest are incorrect or extra. The total GT analyses are 15. So accurate content is 3/15 = 20%. The predicted added 8 incorrect analyses (out of 11 total), so completeness is low. The global similarity is the amount of correct content in predicted relative to GT. Since only 3 out of 15 GT analyses are present in predicted, that's 20%, but also predicted has extra. The overall similarity is probably around 20%, so score 20.

But maybe some analyses partially overlap. For example, analysis2 in predicted is "Bulk RNA Sequencing" on data1-4 (GT's analysis4), so that's a correct analysis. So that's another correct analysis. So total 4 correct (analysis1,2,3, and analysis2 in predicted corresponds to GT analysis4?). Let me check:

GT analysis4 is "Transcriptomics" on data4-8 (bulk RNA). Predicted analysis2 is "Bulk RNA Sequencing" on data1-4 (GT's data4-7?), so that's correct. So analysis2 in predicted matches GT analysis4. So that's another correct analysis. So total 4 correct. So 4/15≈26.6%.

Thus analyses score ≈25.

Results: 0.

Final scores:

Data: 70

Analyses: 25

Results: 0

But let me adjust:

Data's completeness: 10/14 is ~71%, so 70. Accuracy is 100% except for the ATAC missing. So maybe 70.

Analyses: 25.

Results:0.

So the final scores would be:

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 70,
        "Analyses": 25,
        "Results": 0
    }
}
</think>

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 70,
        "Analyses": 25,
        "Results": 0
    }
}

### Explanation:

#### **Data Component (Score: 70/100)**
- **Structure**: Valid JSON with proper key-value pairs (100%).
- **Accuracy**: 
  - Most entries are accurate except for terminology discrepancies (e.g., "Transcriptomics" vs. "bulk RNA sequencing"). These are considered semantically equivalent (80% accuracy).
- **Completeness**: 
  - 10/14 ground-truth entries are captured, missing 4 entries (including critical ATAC-seq data). This reduces the score by ~30%, resulting in ~70%.

---

#### **Analyses Component (Score: 25/100)**
- **Structure**: Valid JSON (100%).
- **Accuracy**: 
  - Only 4/15 analyses (Single-cell RNA, Bulk RNA, Spatial, and Transcriptomics) align with the ground truth. Others are incorrect or extraneous (26.6% accuracy).
- **Completeness**:
