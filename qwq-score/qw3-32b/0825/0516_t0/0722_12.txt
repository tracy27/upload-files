Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

First, for the **Data** section:

The groundtruth has 7 data entries, and the annotation result has 8. I'll check each entry for structure, completeness, and accuracy.

**Structure (10 points):** Both have proper JSON structures with required keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). However, in the groundtruth, there's an entry with id "data_4" appearing twice, which might be a duplication error. But since the user said to ignore IDs, I shouldn't penalize that. The annotation result's entries also follow the structure except maybe one? Wait, looking at the annotation data, all entries have all keys filled except perhaps format in some? Wait no, let me check again. 

Wait in groundtruth data_4 has empty format, same with some others. The annotation data entries all have "format" filled, except maybe none? Wait the annotation's data_5 has "Processed Data" as format. So structure seems okay. So full 10 points here?

**Content Completeness (40 points):** Groundtruth has 7 data objects; annotation has 8. Need to see if each groundtruth sub-object has a corresponding one in the annotation. Let's go through each:

Groundtruth data_1: ATAC-seq, source National Genomics Data Center..., public_id HRA002815. In annotation data_1 is Epigenomics with same public_id HRA002815 and source GSA-human (same as groundtruth's National Genomics...). So matches semantically.

Groundtruth data_2: RNA-seq, public_id HRA0002815. Annotation's data_2 has Transciptomics, public_id HRA000119. Hmm, the public_id differs. But the omics type (RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics) is related. But public_id is different. Is this a match? Maybe not because the public ID is part of the content. So maybe this is a discrepancy.

Wait, groundtruth data_2's public_id is "HRA0002815", whereas in the annotation data_2 has "HRA000119". That's a mismatch. Also, the omics term in groundtruth is RNA-seq vs Transciptomics in annotation. Are those considered equivalent? Probably yes. But the public ID is different, so this might not be a direct match. So this could count as missing, or extra?

Similarly, other entries need checking.

Groundtruth data_3: ChIP-seq, public_id HRA0002815. Annotation's data_3 is Genomics (public_id HRA005668). Not matching. 

Groundtruth data_4 first instance: WGS? No, data_4 in groundtruth has omics "WGS" and another with RNA-seq. Wait, groundtruth data_4 has two entries? Wait looking back:

Groundtruth data array includes data_4 twice? Let me recount:

Looking at the groundtruth data array:

- data_1 (ATAC-seq)
- data_2 (RNA-seq)
- data_3 (ChIP-seq)
- data_4 (WGS)
- data_4 again (another RNA-seq?) – yes, there's a duplicate entry with id=data_4. That's probably an error, but since we don't care about IDs, just content.

So data_4 (first) is WGS, public_id HRA0002815. The second data_4 is RNA-seq with public_id HRA000119.

In the annotation, data_4 is ChIP-seq (public_id GSE122989?), wait no, data_4 in annotation is ChIP-seq with public_id GSE122989 (from NCBI GEO). That's different from groundtruth's WGS. So that might not match either.

Groundtruth data_5: WGS data, public_id HRA005668. Annotation's data_3 has Genomics (WGS?) with public_id HRA005668. So that's a match.

Groundtruth data_6: ATAC-seq, source NCBI GEO, public_id GSE122989. Annotation's data_4 is ChIP-seq from GEO with same public_id. Wait, omics type differs (ATAC vs ChIP). So that's a mismatch.

Groundtruth data_7: RNA expression data, source DepMap, public_id empty. Annotation's data_6 is Transcriptomics from DepMap, public_id "DepMap Public 21Q1". The omics terms (RNA expression vs Transcriptomics) are similar enough. The public_id is different, but maybe acceptable as content completeness? Or does the public ID matter here?

Additionally, the annotation has an extra data entry: data_5 (ChIP-seq from EGA) and data_7, data_8, which aren't present in groundtruth. Since the groundtruth has 7, and the annotation has 8, but some may not correspond.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to map each groundtruth entry to the closest in the annotation.

Groundtruth data_1 (ATAC-seq, HRA002815) → annotation data_1 (Epigenomics, HRA002815). Good.

Groundtruth data_2 (RNA-seq, HRA0002815) → annotation data_2 (Transcriptomics, HRA000119). The public_id is different (HRA0002815 vs HRA000119). So this doesn't match. Unless the public ID is a typo in the groundtruth? The groundtruth's data_2 has public_id HRA0002815, but data_4 (the second) has HRA000119. Maybe a mistake, but assuming it's correct, then this is a missing entry in the annotation?

Alternatively, maybe the annotation's data_2 corresponds to groundtruth's data_4 (the second RNA-seq entry with public_id HRA000119). Because groundtruth data_4 (second) has public_id HRA000119. So that would mean:

Groundtruth data_4 (second instance, RNA-seq, public_id HRA000119) → annotation data_2 (public_id HRA000119). Then that would be a match. But then what about groundtruth data_2?

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that groundtruth has two RNA-seq entries: data_2 (HRA0002815) and data_4 (HRA000119). The annotation's data_2 matches the latter (HRA000119). So groundtruth's data_2 (with HRA0002815) remains unmatched in the annotation. So that's a missing sub-object.

Groundtruth data_3 (ChIP-seq, HRA0002815) → annotation's data_4 (ChIP-seq from GEO). Different source and public ID. Doesn't match.

Groundtruth data_4 (first: WGS, HRA0002815) → no match in annotation. The annotation's data_3 is Genomics (public_id HRA005668, which matches groundtruth's data_5 (WGS data, public_id HRA005668). So that's covered.

Groundtruth data_5 (WGS data, HRA005668) → annotation's data_3 (Genomics, HRA005668). Good.

Groundtruth data_6 (ATAC-seq from GEO) → annotation's data_4 is ChIP-seq from GEO. Omics type mismatch (ATAC vs ChIP). So no match.

Groundtruth data_7 (RNA expression, DepMap) → annotation's data_6 (Transcriptomics from DepMap). Matches except public ID is different but maybe acceptable. The features here are important. Since the public ID isn't critical unless specified? Or is it part of the content? Since the public ID is part of the required fields, missing or incorrect would affect accuracy, but for completeness, if the main content (omics type, source) matches, maybe it counts as present. So that's a match.

So in terms of completeness, the groundtruth has 7 entries. How many are matched in the annotation?

- data_1: matched
- data_2: missing (since HRA0002815 not found)
- data_3: missing (ChIP-seq HRA0002815 not found)
- data_4 (first WGS): missing
- data_4 (second RNA-seq): matched via data_2
- data_5 (WGS data): matched via data_3
- data_6 (ATAC-seq GEO): missing
- data_7: matched via data_6

Wait, that's 4 matches (data_1, data_4's second instance via data_2, data_5 via data_3, data_7 via data_6). The groundtruth has 7, so 4 are covered, missing 3. But wait, the groundtruth data_4 is duplicated, so maybe we should count unique entries. Wait the groundtruth has data_4 appearing twice, but that's likely a mistake. Let me recount properly:

Original groundtruth data entries:

1. data_1 (ATAC, HRA002815)
2. data_2 (RNA-seq, HRA0002815)
3. data_3 (ChIP, HRA0002815)
4. data_4 (WGS, HRA0002815)
5. data_4 (again, RNA-seq, HRA000119)
6. data_5 (WGS data, HRA005668)
7. data_6 (ATAC, GEO)
8. data_7 (RNA expr, DepMap)

Wait actually, in the groundtruth data array, there are 7 entries, but data_4 appears twice (indices 4 and 5). So total entries are 7. The last one is data_7. 

So the correct count is 7 entries. Now, mapping:

- data_1 (ATAC, HRA002815) → annotation data_1 (Epigenomics, same public_id). Matches.
- data_2 (RNA-seq, HRA0002815) → no exact match in annotation. The annotation's data_2 is RNA-seq's second instance (HRA000119).
- data_3 (ChIP, HRA0002815) → no match (annotation's data_4 is ChIP but different public ID)
- data_4 (WGS, HRA0002815) → no match
- data_5 (WGS data, HRA005668) → matches data_3 in anno
- data_6 (ATAC, GEO) → no match (anno's data_4 is ChIP)
- data_7 (DepMap RNA) → matches anno's data_6

Thus, matches are data_1, data_5, data_7 → 3. Missing: data_2, data_3, data_4, data_6 → 4 missing. 

But the annotation has an extra entry (data_4, data_5, data_7, data_8). Each extra beyond the groundtruth's count might get a penalty. Since the groundtruth has 7, and the anno has 8, so one extra. 

Content completeness: Max 40. For each missing sub-object, deduct points. There are 4 missing (out of 7), so 4/7 missing. 40*(3/7)? Or per missing point?

The instructions say deduct points for missing any sub-object. Assuming each missing is a deduction. Since there are 4 missing, each worth (40/7 ≈ ~5.7 per missing). So 4*5.7≈23 deducted, leaving 17? But maybe it's simpler: for each missing, deduct (40/7)*number missing. Alternatively, maybe the deduction is fixed. Let me think again.

Wait, the instructions state: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object." It might be that each missing sub-object reduces the completeness score proportionally. So total possible 40. Number of groundtruth sub-objects is 7. Each missing is (40/7) per missing. 

Missing 4: 4*(40/7) ≈ 22.86 deducted. So 40 - 22.86 ≈ 17.14. But also, the extra sub-objects (1 extra) may also incur penalty? The instruction says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

The anno has an extra data_5 (ChIP from EGA), data_7 (Drug Response), data_8 (Genomics from TARGET). So three extra entries? Wait anno has 8 entries, groundtruth 7. So one extra? Wait anno data_5,6,7,8 are four entries beyond the first four? Wait no: anno entries are 8, groundtruth 7. So one extra. But actually, the anno has data_5, data_6, data_7, data_8, so more than one extra. Let me count:

Groundtruth:7 entries. Anno:8. So one extra. But looking at the entries:

Groundtruth has data_1 to data_7 (7 entries). Anno has data_1 to data_8 (8). So one extra. That extra (data_8) would be penalized. The penalty for extra sub-objects is not clear. The instruction says "may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." If the extra is irrelevant, then maybe 5 points off? Not sure. Maybe 10% of 40 (4 points). So total completeness score: 40 - (missing deductions) - (extra penalty). 

Alternatively, maybe the extra is allowed unless it's irrelevant. Data_8 in anno is Genomics from TARGET, which might be valid but not present in groundtruth. Since it's an extra, but perhaps it's a valid data source. The penalty might be minor. Maybe deduct 2 points for the extra.

Total completeness: 40 - (22.86 + 2) ≈ 15.14. Hmm, but this is getting too granular. Maybe better to think in terms of total matched vs total groundtruth.

If 3 out of 7 are matched (data_1, data_5, data_7), then completeness is (3/7)*40 ≈ 17.14. Plus, maybe subtract further for partial matches? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe some of the missing ones have partial matches. For example, data_2's RNA-seq is present in anno's data_2 but with wrong public ID. Is that considered present or missing? Since public ID is part of the key, maybe it's a mismatch. So still missing.

Alternatively, if the public ID isn't critical, maybe it's considered present. But the problem states to look at semantic equivalence. The omics type is the main thing. Let me see:

For data_2 in groundtruth (RNA-seq), anno's data_2 is Transcriptomics (which is RNA-seq), so the omics type is matched. The public ID difference might be a mistake in the anno, but the key is whether the sub-object exists. Since the public ID is a key part, maybe it's considered missing. But if the public ID is a minor part, maybe it's counted as present. This is ambiguous.

Perhaps the best approach is to assume that each missing groundtruth sub-object deducts (40/7)*number_missing. So 4 missing → ~22.86 deduction, resulting in ~17.14. But rounded to whole numbers. Let's say 17 points for completeness.

Now, **Accuracy (50 points):** For the matched sub-objects, check key-value pairs.

Matched entries:

1. Groundtruth data_1 vs anno data_1:
   - omics: ATAC-seq vs Epigenomics. Are these semantically equivalent? Epigenomics includes ATAC-seq, so maybe considered accurate. 
   - format: groundtruth has "raw data", anno has "BAM". BAM is a raw format, so acceptable.
   - source: both "National Genomics..." vs "Genome Sequence Archive...", which are the same institution, so accurate.
   - public_id: same HRA002815. Perfect.

So this is fully accurate. 

2. Groundtruth data_4 (second instance, RNA-seq, public_id HRA000119) vs anno data_2:
   - omics: RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics. Equivalent?
   - format: groundtruth had "", anno has "Processed Data". Maybe discrepancy here if "raw" was expected, but if processed is okay, depends on context.
   - source: same as above (GSA-human). 
   - public_id: matches (HRA000119).

Assuming "processed" vs "raw" is acceptable, this is mostly accurate except format might be a slight issue. Deduct maybe 2 points? 

3. Groundtruth data_5 (WGS data, public HRA005668) vs anno data_3 (Genomics):
   - omics: WGS data vs Genomics. Genomics could include WGS, so okay.
   - format: groundtruth has "raw data", anno "Processed Data". Again, possible deduction here.
   - source same. public_id matches.

Same as above, maybe 2 points deduction for format.

4. Groundtruth data_7 vs anno data_6:
   - omics: RNA expression vs Transcriptomics. Same.
   - public_id: groundtruth empty vs anno's "DepMap Public...". Since public_id is part of the key, this is a discrepancy. So maybe deduction here.
   - source matches (DepMap). Link is correct.

Public ID difference here might deduct points.

Total accuracy deductions:

Each matched sub-object has some issues. Let's say:

- Data_1: full marks (12.5 each, since 4 sub-objects, 50/4=12.5 per). 
- Data_2 (groundtruth's data_4): maybe 10/12.5
- Data_5 (groundtruth's data_5): 10/12.5
- Data_7: 10/12.5 (due to public ID)
Total: 12.5 + 10 +10 +10 = 42.5. But maybe more precise.

Alternatively, per key:

For data_1: all keys correct except maybe omics term. If "Epigenomics" is acceptable for ATAC-seq, then full 12.5. 

For the others, each has minor issues. Let's say each of the three other matched entries lose 2 points (total 6), so 50 -6=44. 

Overall Data accuracy: 44.

Total Data Score: Structure 10 + Completeness ~17 + Accuracy ~44 → Total 71.

Now **Analyses** section:

Groundtruth has 11 analyses. Annotation has 10.

**Structure (10 points):** Check each analysis has correct keys (id, analysis_name, analysis_data). Some have "label" as well. Groundtruth's analyses include labels (like group labels), while annotation's have some with "label":null. The structure seems okay, as label is optional? Or is it part of the schema? The groundtruth uses "label" where applicable, and the anno also includes it when needed. So structure is good. Full 10.

**Content Completeness (40):** Groundtruth 11, anno 10. Need to see which are missing.

Mapping each groundtruth analysis to anno:

Groundtruth analyses:

1. gene transcription analysis (data_2)
2. Differential expression analysis (depends on analysis_1)
3. allele-specific open chromatin analysis (data1, data5)
4. ACR-to-gene predictions (data1, data2)
5. Differential chromatin accessibility (analysis1, group label)
6. Subtype-specific chromatin accessibility (analysis1)
7. Allele-specific open chromatin analysis (data1, data2) [duplicate?]
8. Chromatin accessibility during treatment (analysis1)
9. Correlation with patient outcomes (analysis1)
10. allele-specific open chromatin (ASOC) (data1, data2)
11. enrichment analysis (data1, data3)

Annotation analyses:

1. Chromatin Accessibility Landscape (data1)
2. Comparison with B-cell (data1,data4)
3. Subtype-specific Chromatin (data1)
4. Allele-specific Open Chromatin (ASOC) (data1,data3)
5. Differential Chromatin Acc between diagnosis & relapse (data1)
6. RFS Analysis (data1, data8)
7. ACR-to-Gene (data1, data2)
8. Drug Response Enrichment (data6,7)
9. TF Motif (data1,2)
10. Survival Analysis (data1,8)

Looking for matches:

Groundtruth analysis_1 (gene transcription analysis, data_2). In anno, maybe analysis_7 (ACR-to-Gene) uses data1 and data2. Not exactly matching name.

Groundtruth analysis_2 (Differential expression, data analysis1). Not present in anno.

Analysis_3 (allele-specific, data1,5). Annotation's analysis_4 (ASOC) uses data1 and data3 (not data5). Not a match.

Analysis_4 (ACR-to-gene predictions) → maybe anno's analysis_7.

Analysis_5 (Differential chromatin acc with groups) → anno's analysis_5 (diff between diag/relapse) is somewhat similar but different data.

Analysis_6 (Subtype-specific) → anno analysis_3 (Subtype-spec).

Analysis_7 (Allele-specific again) → same as analysis_3 and 4 in groundtruth, anno's analysis_4.

Analysis_8 (treatment changes) → not directly present.

Analysis_9 (patient outcomes) → anno analysis_10 (survival).

Analysis_10 (ASOC) → anno analysis_4.

Analysis_11 (enrichment with data1 and data3) → anno analysis_8 (drug response) uses data6 and7. Not same data sources. Not a match.

So matched analyses:

- GT analysis_1: no match
- GT analysis_2: no
- GT analysis_3: partially with anno's analysis_4 (but data3 instead of 5)
- GT analysis_4: matches anno analysis_7
- GT analysis_5: partial with anno analysis_5
- GT analysis_6: matches anno analysis_3
- GT analysis_7: same as analysis_3, but anno has analysis_4
- GT analysis_8: no
- GT analysis_9: matches anno analysis_10 (survival)
- GT analysis_10: matches anno analysis_4
- GT analysis_11: no

So total matches: analysis_4 (GT) → anno analysis_7; analysis_5→partial, analysis_6→3, analysis_9→10, analysis_10→4. That's about 5-6 matches. 

Groundtruth has 11, anno 10. Missing: GT analyses 1,2,3 (partially?), 7,8,11 → 6 missing. 

Completeness: 40 - (6*(40/11)) ≈ 40 - 21.8 ≈ 18.2. Plus extras? Anno has one less, so no extra. So maybe 18.

Accuracy: For the matched ones, check their keys.

Take analysis_4 (GT) vs anno analysis_7:

GT analysis_4: ACR-to-gene predictions, data1,2. Anno's analysis_7 is ACR-to-Gene Assoc, data1,2. Name is similar, data matches. So accurate.

Analysis_6 (GT subtype-specific) → anno analysis_3: names match, data same (data1). Good.

Analysis_9 (GT outcome correlation) → anno analysis_10 (survival analysis). Names are related (outcome vs survival). Data uses analysis1 vs data1 and8. Partial match. Maybe deduct points.

Analysis_10 (GT ASOC) → anno analysis_4. Matches except data sources (data1 and3 vs GT's data1 and5). Data mismatch here. So accuracy loss.

Overall, maybe the accuracy is around 35/50. 

Total Analyses Score: 10 + 18 + 35 = 63.

Finally **Results** section:

Groundtruth has 6 results. Anno has 10.

**Structure (10):** All entries have analysis_id, metrics, value, features. Looks okay. Full 10.

**Content Completeness (40):** Groundtruth 6, anno 10. Need to see which are missing.

Groundtruth results:

1. analysis_1: features like TCF3::PBX1 etc.
2. analysis_2: features like p<0.05, TSS, etc.
3. analysis_3: multiple entries (median 14.39%, features TssA, etc.)
4. analysis_3 (another): features rs7090445 etc.
5. analysis_3 (third): MECOM etc.
6. analysis_10: ASOC regions, p<2.2e-16.

Anno results:

10 entries covering analysis_1 to analysis_10. Let's map:

GT result1 (analysis_1) → anno has analysis_1's result with features ACR types. Matches? The features in GT are specific genes, anno's are categories like ACR in Quies regions. Not exact, but related. Maybe counts as present.

GT result2 (analysis_2) → anno has analysis_2's result with overlap percentages and features like IL7R. Not matching the original analysis_2 (differential expression), but the anno's analysis_2 is a different analysis. Hmm, analysis_2 in groundtruth is Differential expression analysis (depending on analysis_1). The anno's analysis_2 is "Comparison with B-cell Progenitors". Their results might not align. So GT result2's analysis_2 might not exist in anno.

GT result3 (analysis_3's first entry) → anno's analysis_3 has "Subtype-specific ACRs" with features like ETV6::RUNX1 etc. Matches.

GT result3's second and third entries (analysis_3 again) → anno's analysis_4 has features like rs7090445 (matches GT's rs7090445 entry) and MECOM/HOXA9 (GT's third entry). So those are covered in anno's analysis_4.

GT result6 (analysis_10) → anno's analysis_4's result includes ASOC regions (maybe part of the features?), and analysis_10's survival includes some features but not ASOC p-values.

Wait, GT's analysis_10's result has p value <2.2e-16. Anno's analysis_4 (ASOC analysis) has percentage 14.39% which matches GT's analysis_3's median. So maybe GT's analysis_10's result isn't present in anno.

So mapped:

- GT result1 (analysis_1): anno's analysis_1 → present but features differ? The metrics and features are different. If the existence matters, it's present but accuracy might suffer.

- GT result2 (analysis_2): no corresponding result in anno (since analysis_2 in anno is different).

- GT result3 (analysis_3 first): present in anno analysis_3.

- GT results 4 and 5 (analysis_3 second and third) → present in anno analysis_4.

- GT result6 (analysis_10): not present in anno results. The anno's analysis_4 is for ASOC but under analysis_4 (groundtruth analysis_10 is analysis_10). So GT analysis_10's result (ASOC regions with p value) might be in anno's analysis_4? 

Looking at anno's analysis_4 (Allele-specific Open Chromatin (ASOC) Analysis) has a result with percentage (14.39%), which matches GT analysis_3's result. The p value is in GT analysis_10's result. So GT analysis_10's result is missing in anno.

Total GT results: 6 entries. Matched:

- analysis_1 (partially)
- analysis_3 (twice)
- analysis_3 (third time via analysis_4)
- analysis_3's third entry via analysis_4
- analysis_3's second via analysis_4

Wait, this is confusing. Let's list:

GT has:

- analysis_1: 1 result
- analysis_2: 1
- analysis_3: 3 results (three entries)
- analysis_10: 1

Total 6.

Anno has:

- analysis_1: 1
- analysis_2: 1
- analysis_3: 1
- analysis_4: 1
- analysis_5:1
- analysis_6:1
- analysis_7:1
- analysis_8:1
- analysis_9:1
- analysis_10:1

So anno covers analysis_1,2,3,4, etc., but the specific results for GT's analysis_3's multiple entries are spread into analysis_3 and analysis_4 in anno. So:

GT analysis_3's three results are covered by anno's analysis_3 and analysis_4. So that's 2 entries covering 3 GT results → maybe considered present.

GT analysis_10's result (analysis_10's p value) isn't present in anno (analysis_10 in anno is survival, not ASOC's p value).

GT analysis_2's result is present in anno analysis_2 (but the analysis itself is different, so the result might not match the intended analysis).

So maybe:

Present: analysis_1 (partly), analysis_2 (but different), analysis_3's results, and analysis_4's results. That's 4 out of 6. Missing: analysis_2's result (since the analysis is different), analysis_10's result, and possibly analysis_1's result if features are considered important.

So missing 3 results (analysis_2, analysis_10, and possibly analysis_1's features). Thus, completeness deduction: 3*(40/6)= 20 points. 40-20=20.

Extras: anno has 4 more results (analysis_5 to analysis_10 excluding overlaps). So 4 extra, but since GT has 6, anno's 10 means 4 extra. Penalty for extras: maybe 4*(40/10)=16? Not sure. Maybe 5 points deduction for extra entries.

Total completeness: 20-5=15?

**Accuracy (50):** For the matched results, check accuracy.

Analysis_1: GT has features like TCF3::PBX1 etc., anno's result lists ACR types (Quies, Enh, etc.). Different features, so accuracy loss here.

Analysis_2: anno's analysis_2 result has features like IL7R, which aren't in GT's analysis_2's features (which had p<0.05, TSS, E2F6, etc.). So mismatched.

Analysis_3's first entry in GT (median 14.39%) is in anno's analysis_3 with "17,981 subtype-specific ACRs identified"—different metric. So accuracy loss.

Analysis_4's results in anno cover GT's analysis_3's second and third entries (features like rs7090445, MECOM). Those match, so good.

Analysis_10 in anno has survival features which don't match GT's analysis_10's ASOC p-value.

Total accuracy might be low. Maybe around 30/50.

Total Results Score: 10 (structure) +15 (completeness) +30 (accuracy)=55.

Final Scores:

Data: 10+17+44=71

Analyses:10+18+35=63

Results:10+15+30=55

But I might have miscalculated. Let me adjust:

For Data completeness: If 3 matched out of 7, (3/7)*40≈17, plus penalty for extra (1 entry) maybe 2 → 15.

Accuracy for Data: 44.

So total Data: 71.

Analyses: Maybe completeness 18, accuracy 35 → 63.

Results: Structure 10, completeness 15, accuracy 30 → 55.
