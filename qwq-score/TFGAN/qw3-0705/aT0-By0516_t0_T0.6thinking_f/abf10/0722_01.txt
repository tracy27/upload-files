Okay, I need to score the annotation result based on the groundtruth provided. Let me start by understanding the task requirements again. The user wants me to evaluate three components: data, analyses, and results. Each component has its own score out of 100, broken down into structure (10 points), content completeness (40 points), and content accuracy (50 points). 

First, let me tackle the "data" section. The groundtruth has four data entries with specific omics types, sources, public IDs, etc. The annotation result lists seven data entries. 

Starting with structure: Each data entry in both must have the correct keys. Groundtruth uses "id", "omics", "link", "format", "source", "public_id". The annotation result's data objects seem to have the same keys except maybe "public_id" which in groundtruth is an array, but in some cases like data_2 (second one) it's a single string. Wait, looking at groundtruth's data_2 second entry, public_id is "PRJEB23709" as a string, but others have arrays. Hmm, so maybe that's an inconsistency in the groundtruth itself. But the annotation's data entries all have "public_id" as strings except maybe data_1 which has a single entry in the array? Wait no, looking back:

Wait, in the groundtruth data, data_1 has public_id as ["GSE120575","GSE115978","GSE123813"], which is an array. Data_2 first entry has ["GSE78220","GSE91061"], but the second data_2 (duplicate id?) has "PRJEB23709" as a string. That might be an error in the groundtruth's structure because the second data_2's public_id isn't an array. However, the annotation result's data entries all have public_id as strings (like GSE120575, etc.), so maybe they formatted it correctly as strings. Wait, but according to the groundtruth's first data_1's public_id is an array, but others have mixed types. This could be a problem. However, since the structure part is just about correct JSON structure regardless of content, maybe the annotation's structure is okay if their keys are present. So checking each data object in the annotation: they have all required keys. So structure score would be full 10.

Now content completeness. Groundtruth has 4 data entries (though data_2 appears twice with same id?), but looking closely, there's data_1, data_2 (two entries with same id?), data_3. Wait, in groundtruth's data array, the second data_2 has the same id as the first data_2? Wait, looking at the groundtruth's data array:

Groundtruth data:
[
    {id: data_1},
    {id: data_2}, // first occurrence
    {id: data_2}, // second occurrence, same id? That's invalid JSON because duplicate ids within the same array?
    {id: data_3}
]

Wait, that's a problem. The third element in data has id=data_2 again. That's an invalid structure because IDs should be unique. But maybe that's a mistake in the groundtruth. However, when evaluating the annotation's completeness, we have to consider the groundtruth's intended structure. Perhaps that's a typo, and the third entry should be data_3 or data_4. Assuming that the groundtruth might have an error here, but the user expects us to use it as is. 

The annotation result has seven data entries (data_1 to data_7). Let's see if they cover all groundtruth's data sub-objects. 

Looking at groundtruth's data:

First data entry (data_1): omics is scRNA-seq, source GEO, public_ids GSE120575, GSE115978, GSE123813. The annotation's data_1 has omics Transcriptomics, link to GSE120575, format Single-cell RNA-seq, source GEO, public_id GSE120575. So this corresponds to part of the first groundtruth data_1's public IDs. But groundtruth's data_1 has three GSE IDs, but the annotation's data_1 only covers one of them. Wait, but the groundtruth's data_1 includes those three as public_ids. But in the annotation, each public ID seems split into separate entries. Like data_1 is GSE120575, data_2 is GSE115978, data_3 is GSE123813. So the three public IDs from groundtruth's data_1 are now three separate data entries in the annotation. So that's correct splitting. 

Then groundtruth's second data_2 (first instance) has omics Transcriptome-level gene expression data, source GEO, public IDs GSE78220, GSE91061. In the annotation, these become data_4 and data_5 (GSE78220 and GSE91061 respectively). 

The third data_2 in groundtruth (with ENA source, PRJEB23709) becomes data_6 in the annotation. 

Fourth data_3 in groundtruth (genome sequencing, dbGaP phs000452.v3.p1) becomes data_7 in the annotation. 

So the groundtruth's four data entries (even though one has a duplicate id) are represented correctly as seven in the annotation. Because the first data_1 had three public IDs split into three entries, the second data_2 (first instance) splits into two, and the third data_2 (ENA) and fourth data_3 become data_6 and 7. So the annotation covers all the groundtruth's data sub-objects, except perhaps the duplicate data_2 entry in groundtruth might be a mistake. Since the user says to consider sub-objects with semantic correspondence, even if IDs differ, the content is covered. So completeness should be full 40? Or did I miss anything?

Wait the groundtruth's data_3 (the fourth entry) has omics as genome sequencing, but in the annotation's data_7, omics is Transcriptomics. That's a discrepancy. Oh! Here's a problem. Groundtruth's data_3 has omics: "genome sequencing", but the annotation's data_7 has "Transcriptomics". So that's incorrect. So that's a missing sub-object? Wait, no, the groundtruth's data_3's omics is genome sequencing, but the annotation's corresponding data_7 is transcriptomics. So that's a content accuracy issue, but in terms of completeness, does the annotation have a sub-object covering that data_3? Since the annotation's data_7 has the correct public_id (phs000452.v3.p1 from dbGaP), but omics type is wrong, so the sub-object exists but with wrong omics. So completeness is okay (they included it), but accuracy is wrong. 

Therefore, content completeness for data is full 40 points because all groundtruth data sub-objects are present in the annotation as separate entries (except the duplicate data_2 which may be a groundtruth error). 

For content accuracy (50 points), each sub-object's keys must be correct. Let's check each:

Groundtruth data_1 (split into 3 in annotation):

Each of the first three entries (data_1, data_2, data_3 in annotation) correspond to the public IDs in groundtruth data_1. Their omics is "Transcriptomics" vs groundtruth's "scRNA-seq". Is "Transcriptomics" considered equivalent? Maybe yes, because scRNA-seq is a type of transcriptomics. So maybe acceptable. The format in annotation is "Single-cell RNA-seq" which matches "scRNA-seq". So that's accurate. 

Source is GEO, same as groundtruth. Link is correct. Public ID matches exactly. So these are accurate. 

Next, groundtruth's second data_2 (first instance with GSE78220 and GSE91061). The annotation splits them into data_4 and 5. Their omics is "Transcriptomics" vs "Transcriptome-level gene expression data" â€“ semantically equivalent. Format in annotation is "Bulk RNA-seq", which matches "Transcriptome-level" (bulk vs single-cell). Since groundtruth's entry was under Transcriptome-level, but the annotation specifies bulk, that's accurate. 

Public IDs match. Sources are correct. Links are correct. 

Third data_2 (ENA's PRJEB23709) becomes data_6 in annotation. Omics: "Transcriptomics" vs "Transcriptome-level", same. Source is ENA, correct. Public ID correct. Format "Bulk RNA-seq" aligns. 

Fourth data_3 (genome sequencing, dbGaP) becomes data_7. Here, omics is "Transcriptomics" instead of "genome sequencing". That's a direct error. So this sub-object's omics key is wrong. So that's an inaccuracy. Also, the format in annotation is "Bulk RNA-seq", but groundtruth's was genome sequencing. So format and omics are both wrong here. 

So the accuracy deductions would be for data_7: omics and format. 

Additionally, check other fields. Metrics like link: groundtruth had empty links, but the annotation filled them in, which is better, so that's okay. 

Thus, for content accuracy:

Out of 50 points, how much to deduct?

Total sub-objects in groundtruth (assuming 4 entries despite the duplicate id) but in reality, they have:

Original groundtruth data array has 4 entries (but the third is duplicate id). Assuming that the third entry (data_2 with ENA) is separate, so 4 entries. However, the annotation has 7 entries, but each corresponds to the groundtruth's sub-components except the genome sequencing one. 

The problem is data_7's omics and format. So for that sub-object, the omics is incorrect (genome vs transcriptomics), so that's a major error. Let's say each key is worth some points. 

Assuming each sub-object contributes equally to the 50 points. There are 4 groundtruth data entries (though split into more in annotation), but let's think per groundtruth's original data entries:

Groundtruth data_1: split into 3 in annotation, all accurate except maybe omics term. Since "scRNA-seq" is a subset of transcriptomics, maybe acceptable. So full marks for those three.

Groundtruth data_2 (first instance with two GSEs): split into two, both accurate. 

Groundtruth data_2 (second instance ENA): becomes data_6, accurate. 

Groundtruth data_3 (genome sequencing): in annotation as data_7 but omics and format wrong. 

So the error is in one sub-object (groundtruth data_3). Since each of the 4 groundtruth data entries would contribute to the accuracy score, perhaps each is worth (50 /4)=12.5 points. The error here would lose maybe half of that (6.25) for the omics and format. Total deduction: ~6.25. So accuracy score would be 50 -6.25 =43.75, rounded to 44? 

Alternatively, since there are 7 sub-objects in the annotation, but the problem is only in one (data_7). If each key in each sub-object counts, then for data_7, two keys (omics and format) are wrong. Suppose each key is worth (50 / (number of key-value pairs across all groundtruth sub-objects)). Not sure. Maybe better to consider each sub-object's accuracy as a whole. 

Alternatively, since the main issue is the omics type being wrong for data_7 (genome vs transcriptomics), which is a critical error, perhaps deducting 10 points from 50, resulting in 40. 

Hmm. Maybe I'll go with 40 points for content accuracy (so total data score would be 10 +40 +40=90). 

Now moving to Analyses section.

Groundtruth analyses have five entries (analysis_1 to 4, and another analysis_3 which is a loop? Wait looking at groundtruth analyses:

Groundtruth analyses:
[
    analysis_1: Single-cell cluster and diff expr analysis, data [data_1]
    analysis_2: Functional enrichment, data [analysis_1]
    analysis_3: Same name as analysis_1, data [analysis_3] (self-reference? Probably a typo)
    analysis_4: ICT outcome sig, data [data_2, data_3]
]

Wait, analysis_3 has analysis_data pointing to itself ("analysis_3"), which is likely an error. 

Annotation analyses have six entries (analysis_1 to 6). 

Structure: Check if each analysis has the correct keys. Groundtruth uses "id", "analysis_name", "analysis_data". Annotation adds "label" which is not present in groundtruth. Wait, looking at the groundtruth's analyses entries:

Groundtruth analyses have keys: id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The annotation's analyses include an extra "label" field. 

So the structure in the annotation includes an extra key "label", which wasn't in the groundtruth. Therefore, the structure is incorrect. So structure points for analyses would be less. 

Wait, the structure score is for the correct JSON structure of each object. The groundtruth's analyses objects don't have "label", so the presence of "label" in the annotation is an extra key. Since structure requires adherence to the groundtruth's structure, this is a structural error. 

Therefore, the structure score for analyses would be reduced. How much? Maybe half the structure points (5/10). Because adding an extra key violates the structure. Unless the groundtruth allows optional keys. But according to the task instructions, structure must match the groundtruth's structure. Since groundtruth doesn't have "label", but the annotation does, that's a structure error. 

But wait, the user said "structure focuses on correct JSON structure of each object and proper key-value pair structure". Maybe the keys must exactly match. So if the annotation added an extra key, it's a structure error. So structure score for analyses would be 0? Or partial? Maybe the required keys are present (id, analysis_name, analysis_data), so structure is okay. The extra key might not be penalized unless specified. Hmm, the instructions are unclear. Let me recheck: 

Structure criteria: "correct JSON structure of each object and proper key-value pair structure in sub-objects. Do not score on the actual content of the key-value pairs."

So perhaps as long as the required keys are present, even with extra keys, the structure is okay. So the presence of "label" is an extra key but doesn't break structure. Then structure is 10 points. 

Wait, maybe the structure is about having the necessary keys. Since groundtruth's analyses have id, analysis_name, analysis_data, and the annotation includes all those plus label, which is allowed as an additional key. So structure is correct. So structure score remains 10.

Next, content completeness. Groundtruth has five analysis sub-objects. The annotation has six. Need to check if all groundtruth analyses are present in the annotation. 

Groundtruth analyses:

1. analysis_1: name "Single-cell cluster and differential expression analysis", data [data_1]
2. analysis_2: "Functional enrichment analysis", data [analysis_1]
3. analysis_3: same name as analysis_1, data [analysis_3] (likely a typo)
4. analysis_4: "ICT outcome signature", data [data_2, data_3]

Wait, the third analysis_3 has analysis_data pointing to itself, which is probably an error. Assuming that the groundtruth's analysis_3 is meant to refer to analysis_1 or another, but it's a mistake. 

Now, in the annotation's analyses:

They have analysis_1 to 6. Let's map each groundtruth analysis to the annotation:

Groundtruth analysis_1: name "Single-cell cluster and differential expression analysis", data [data_1]

Annotation has analysis_1 named "Single cell cluster", data [data_1]. Close enough semantically. So this is matched.

Groundtruth analysis_2: "Functional enrichment analysis" â†’ annotation doesn't have this exact name. The closest might be analysis_3: "Pathway analysis" or analysis_2: "Differential analysis". Not sure. 

Groundtruth analysis_3: The name is same as analysis_1, but with data pointing to itself. Not clear. 

Groundtruth analysis_4: "ICT outcome signature", data [data_2, data_3]. Annotation has analysis_4 named "Classification analysis", data [data_4]. The data references might not match directly, but need to see.

Wait, the data in groundtruth's analysis_4 is ["data_2", "data_3"]. In the annotation, data_2 corresponds to GSE115978, which is part of groundtruth's data_1 split. So data_2 in groundtruth's analysis_4 refers to the original data_2 (the first one with GSE78220?), but in the annotation's data_4 is GSE78220. 

Hmm, this is getting complex. Let's approach systematically.

For content completeness (40 points), we need to check if all groundtruth's analyses are present in the annotation. 

Groundtruth's analysis_1: The annotation's analysis_1 has a slightly different name ("Single cell cluster" vs "Single-cell cluster and differential expression analysis"). But semantically close enough. So that's covered. 

Groundtruth analysis_2: "Functional enrichment analysis" â†’ in the annotation, analysis_3 is "Pathway analysis", which might be a synonym. So that could count as equivalent. 

Groundtruth analysis_3: The name is same as analysis_1 but with a self-referencing data. Since the name is same as analysis_1, and the data is invalid, perhaps the annotator didn't include this, but since it's likely a mistake in groundtruth, maybe it's not counted. 

Groundtruth analysis_4: "ICT outcome signature" â†’ the annotation's analysis_4 is "Classification analysis", which might be part of that. The data references in groundtruth's analysis_4 are data_2 and data_3 (from groundtruth's data array). In the annotation, data_2 is part of groundtruth's data_1 split, so maybe the annotation's analysis_4 uses data_4 (which is GSE78220) which is part of groundtruth's data_2. Not sure, but the name difference might mean it's not captured. Alternatively, analysis_5 in the annotation mentions ICT_outcome labels, so perhaps that's the ICT outcome signature. 

This is tricky. It might require deeper analysis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the annotation covers all but one of the groundtruth analyses. For example, missing "Functional enrichment analysis", but includes pathway analysis which is similar. 

If all groundtruth analyses except analysis_3 (the problematic one) are covered, then completeness would be 4/5 entries, so 40*(4/5)=32? But need to consider that analysis_3 might not count as valid. 

Alternatively, if the groundtruth's analysis_3 is considered invalid due to the data loop, then there are effectively 4 valid analyses in groundtruth. If the annotation includes all 4, then completeness is full. 

This is ambiguous. To proceed, perhaps assume that the annotator captured all meaningful analyses except the flawed analysis_3. Thus, the annotation has 6 analyses, possibly covering all groundtruth's valid ones. 

Therefore, completeness might be full 40. 

Content accuracy (50 points):

Check each matched analysis's key-value pairs. 

Take analysis_1:

Groundtruth analysis_1: name "Single-cell cluster and differential expression analysis", data [data_1]

Annotation's analysis_1: name "Single cell cluster", data [data_1], with a label field. 

The name is slightly shorter but semantically equivalent. The data is correct. The extra label is okay for structure but not part of the groundtruth's content accuracy. Since content accuracy is about the key-value pairs that exist in the groundtruth's object. Since the groundtruth's analysis doesn't have a label, the presence of label doesn't affect accuracy for existing keys. 

Thus, analysis_1 is accurate (name and data match sufficiently).

Groundtruth analysis_2: "Functional enrichment analysis", data [analysis_1]

In the annotation, analysis_3 is "Pathway analysis", data [data_1]. The name difference is a concern. "Functional enrichment" vs "Pathway analysis" are related but not exact. Depending on context, maybe they're considered equivalent. If not, that's an inaccuracy. 

Assuming they are different, that's a problem. 

Groundtruth analysis_4: "ICT outcome signature", data [data_2, data_3]. In the annotation, analysis_5 has label ICT_outcome and data [data5, data6, data7]. The data references correspond to groundtruth's data_2 and data_3 (since data5 is GSE91061, data6 is PRJEB23709, data7 is the problematic genome one). But the name "Validation analysis" vs "ICT outcome signature" might not match. However, the purpose might align. 

This requires judgment. 

Overall, there might be inaccuracies in names leading to deductions. Suppose two analyses have name mismatches (analysis_2 and analysis_4), each costing 10 points (total 20 deducted). Plus other possible errors. 

Alternatively, if most are accurate except one or two, maybe accuracy is around 40. 

This is quite involved. Let me try a different approach. 

For content accuracy, each analysis's keys (name and data) must align. 

Analysis_1: name is close enough, data matches (data_1 in both). Accurate.

Analysis_2 (groundtruth) vs annotation's analysis_3 (pathway): name difference, but data is correct (data_1). So name mismatch: deduct some points.

Analysis_4 (groundtruth's ICT outcome) vs analysis_5 in annotation (validation with ICT labels): data references are different (annotation uses data5,6,7 which are groundtruth's data_2 and 3 split into multiple entries). The name "ICT outcome signature" vs "Validation analysis" may not align. So name inaccuracy here. 

Other analyses in the annotation (analysis_2,4,6) may not have direct counterparts but add new analyses. Since content accuracy only applies to those that exist in groundtruth, extra analyses don't penalize here, only missing or inaccurate ones. 

Thus, for the groundtruth analyses (excluding analysis_3):

Accuracy deductions for analysis_2 and 4. Each analysis is worth (50/4)=12.5 points. If two are partially incorrect, say losing 5 each, total 10 deducted. So accuracy score 40.

Adding up: structure 10 + completeness 40 + accuracy 40 = 90 for analyses.

Now Results section:

Groundtruth's results have four entries, all under analysis_1. They list features like genes.

Annotation's results have many entries across different analysis_ids (analysis_1 to 6). 

Structure: Check if each result has analysis_id, metrics, value, features. Groundtruth's results have those keys, and the annotation does too. So structure is 10 points.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has four results under analysis_1. The annotation has 17 entries (many under analysis_1 to 6). Need to see if all groundtruth's results are present. 

Groundtruth's results are four entries with features like SPP1, RNASE1 etc., C1QA-C1QC, etc. Looking at the annotation's results for analysis_1: they have entries with features that include some of these genes. For example, the first entry in groundtruth's results has features like SPP1, RNASE1, etc., which are present in the first annotation's analysis_1 features. Similarly, other entries may overlap. 

However, the groundtruth's results are four distinct feature lists under analysis_1. The annotation's analysis_1 has three entries (first three results entries in the annotation). Wait the annotation's results under analysis_1 have three entries with features lists. Comparing to groundtruth's four entries under analysis_1, the annotation is missing one. 

Thus, completeness: groundtruth has four results entries (all under analysis_1), annotation has three. So missing one. Deduct 10 points (40 total, so 3/4 gives 30). Or per item: each is worth 10 points (40/4=10). Missing one deducts 10, so 30 left? 

Plus, the annotation has additional results under other analyses (analysis_2 to 6), but those are extra and don't penalize completeness (only missing groundtruth's count matters). 

So content completeness: 30 points.

Content accuracy: Check each of the three annotation's analysis_1 results against groundtruth's four. The first three annotation entries for analysis_1 have features that mostly match the groundtruth's first three, but missing the fourth. Additionally, some features might be off. 

For example, groundtruth's fourth entry in results has features like TREM2, SPP1, etc. but the annotation's analysis_1 third entry has RRM2, etc. Wait need to check details:

Groundtruth's results:

Result 1: features include SPP1, RNASE1, MT1G, SEPP1, FOLR2, NUPR1, KLHDC8B, CCL18, MMP12, APOC2, C3, C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, IDO1, FCER1A, S100A12, APOBEC3A, SELL, CXCL10, LCK, TIGIT, PTPRCAP, KLRK1, LAT, IL32, IFITM1, CCL5.

Annotation's first analysis_1 result has features like TREM2, SPP1, RNASE1, ..., C1QC. This overlaps but includes TREM2 which isn't in the first groundtruth's first result. So discrepancy here.

The second groundtruth result's features are C1QA-C3, etc., which match the second annotation entry. 

Third groundtruth entry has RRM2 etc., which matches the third annotation entry. 

Fourth groundtruth result has more features including ABCA6, LEF1, etc., which aren't in any of the annotation's analysis_1 results. 

Thus, the annotation's analysis_1 results have three entries covering three of the four groundtruth entries but missing the fourth. 

Additionally, the features lists may have discrepancies. For instance, the first annotation's features include TREM2, which wasn't in the first groundtruth's features. So accuracy is affected. 

Calculating accuracy: 

Each groundtruth result entry (four) contributes (50/4)=12.5 points. 

First groundtruth result: partially matches (missing some features, added TREM2). So maybe 75% accuracy here (9.4 points). 

Second and third are fully matched? Maybe 12.5 each. 

Fourth is missing entirely, so 0. 

Total accuracy: 9.4 +12.5+12.5 +0 = 34.4 â‰ˆ 34. 

Thus, content accuracy would be around 34. 

Total results score: 10 (structure) +30 (completeness) +34 (accuracy) = 74. 

Alternatively, maybe more precise deductions. 

Final Scores:

Data: 10 +40 +40 =90

Analyses: 10 +40 +40=90

Results: 10 +30 +34=74

But I might have made mistakes in my estimations. Let me adjust:

For results accuracy: 

The fourth groundtruth result is completely missing in the annotation's analysis_1. So that's a full loss of 12.5 points. The first result has an extra feature (TREM2 not in groundtruth's first?), so maybe partial loss there. 

Suppose the first entry's features are mostly correct except for TREM2 addition, so 10 points instead of 12.5. 

Total accuracy: 10 +12.5 +12.5 =35. 

So results accuracy 35, total 10+30+35=75. 

Alternatively, maybe the first result's features are mostly correct (most genes are present except TREM2). The groundtruth's first result doesn't have TREM2? Wait, looking at groundtruth's first result:

Groundtruth first result's features list includes:

"SPP1", "RNASE1", "MT1G", "SEPP1", "FOLR2", "NUPR1", "KLHDC8B", "CCL18", "MMP12", "APOC2", "C3", "C1QA", "C1QB", "C1QC", "IDO1", "FCER1A", "S100A12", "APOBEC3A", "SELL", "CXCL10", "LCK", "TIGIT", "PTPRCAP", "KLRK1", "LAT", "IL32", "IFITM1", "CCL5".

Annotation's first analysis_1 result includes:

"TREM2", "SPP1", "RNASE1", "MT1G", "SEPP1", "FOLR2", "NUPR1", "KLHDC8B", "CCL18", "MMP12", "APOC2", "C3", "C1QA", "C1QB", "C1QC".

Missing some genes (IDO1 onwards), but added TREM2. So the match is partial. Maybe half credit for that entry (6.25). 

Second entry matches well (groundtruth's second entry's features are a subset of the second annotation's features?), so full.

Third entry matches third groundtruth's features (RRM2 etc.), so full. 

Fourth entry is missing: 0.

Total accuracy:6.25 +12.5 +12.5 =31.25â‰ˆ31. 

So total results score: 10+30+31=71. 

This is getting too detailed. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the earlier numbers.

Final scores:

Data: 90

Analyses:90

Results:74

But let me confirm:

For Data's accuracy: the genome sequencing entry was wrong omics and format. That's one out of four groundtruth entries (assuming the four entries are valid). So 50*(3/4)=37.5? Or considering that the fourth entry's omics and format are both wrong, perhaps deduct 10 points from 50, making 40.

Thus, Data accuracy is 40. 

Analyses: Maybe the functional enrichment wasn't covered, so accuracy deduction. Suppose 40 points.

Results: 74 as above.

Final Scores:

{
    "Data": 90,
    "Analyses": 90,
    "Results": 74
}

But I'm not sure. Maybe results lower. Alternatively, maybe results' completeness was lower.

Alternatively, if the results' completeness was missing one entry (out of four), so 3/4 of 40 is 30. Accuracy: if three of four are half correct, maybe 37.5. Total 77.5. 

Alternatively, I'll settle with:

Data: 90,

Analyses: 85 (maybe deducted 5 for some inaccuracies),

Results: 70.

But the initial estimates were 90,90,74. I'll present that.
