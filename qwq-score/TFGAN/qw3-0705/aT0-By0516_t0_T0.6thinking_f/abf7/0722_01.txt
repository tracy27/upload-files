Okay, I need to score the annotation result based on the groundtruth provided. Let me start by understanding the task requirements again. The user wants me to evaluate three components: data, analyses, and results. Each component has its own score out of 100, broken down into structure (10 points), content completeness (40 points), and content accuracy (50 points). 

First, let me tackle the "data" section. The groundtruth has four data entries with specific omics types, sources, public IDs, etc. The annotation result has seven data entries. Wait, I should check each one.

Looking at the data:

Groundtruth data:
- data_1: scRNA-seq from GEO with public IDs [GSE120575, GSE115978, GSE123813]
- data_2: Transcriptome-level gene expression data from GEO (GSE78220, GSE91061)
- Another data_2 entry but source ENA and PRJEB23709 (probably a duplicate?)
- data_3: genome sequencing from dbGaP phs000452.v3.p1

Annotation data:
- data_1 to data_7. Each splits the original data into more entries. For example, groundtruth data_1's three GEO IDs are split into data_1, 2, 3 in the annotation. Similarly, data_2's GEO entries become data_4 and 5. The ENA entry becomes data_6, and dbGaP is data_7.

So the structure here: Each public_id in groundtruth that had multiple entries got split into separate data objects. The structure in annotation uses proper JSON and each sub-object has the required keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). So structure is okay. Maybe some extra sub-objects? Since groundtruth has 4 data entries, but annotation has 7, but the groundtruth's data_2 has two entries (which might be an error?), so maybe the annotation correctly split them. 

Wait, in the groundtruth data_2 has public_id as an array, but then there's another data_2 with different source and public_id. That's probably a duplication. The annotation separated those into different entries. So the structure is correct, so structure score: 10/10.

Content completeness: Groundtruth expects certain sub-objects. Each sub-object in groundtruth must be present in the annotation. Let's see:

Groundtruth data_1 (scRNA-seq) with three GEO IDs. The annotation has three entries (data_1,2,3) each with one GEO ID. So they covered all. Then data_2 (GEO entries) split into data_4 and 5, which are present. The ENA (data_6) and dbGaP (data_7) are also there. So all original data are represented, even if split. But since the groundtruth had duplicates (data_2 appearing twice), the annotation corrected it by splitting into separate entries, which is better. However, the completeness requires that all groundtruth sub-objects are present. Since the groundtruth's data_2 entries (even duplicated) should be considered. Wait, actually, in the groundtruth, data_2 has two entries with the same id "data_2". That might be an error, so perhaps the annotation fixed that by splitting into separate data entries. So the completeness is good, no missing sub-objects. The extra data entries in the annotation are necessary because the groundtruth had duplicates. So completeness score: 40/40?

Wait, but maybe the groundtruth's data_2 is supposed to have both GEO and ENA entries but under the same ID, which is incorrect. The annotation correctly separated them into different data entries. So the groundtruth might have an error here. Since we're evaluating the annotation against the groundtruth, even if the groundtruth has an error, we have to follow it. Wait, but the instruction says to consider semantic correspondence. The groundtruth's data_2 has two entries with same ID but different sources. That's invalid. The annotation correctly split them into separate data entries. So the groundtruth's structure might be wrong, but according to the problem, we have to take the groundtruth as the reference. Hmm, this complicates things. Wait, the problem states that data_id or analysis_id are just unique identifiers; we shouldn't penalize if the IDs differ but the content is same. So in the groundtruth, the two data_2 entries have different sources and public_ids. The annotation created separate entries for each, so they are accounted for. Thus, the groundtruth's data_2 entries are covered in the annotation. Hence, no missing sub-objects. The extra entries in the annotation are needed because the groundtruth had duplicates, so perhaps the annotation is correct here. Therefore, content completeness is full 40 points.

Content accuracy: Check if the key-values match. For example, in groundtruth data_1, omics is "scRNA-seq", whereas the annotation uses "Transcriptomics". Is that a discrepancy? The problem says to prioritize semantic alignment. "scRNA-seq" is single-cell RNA sequencing, which is a type of transcriptomics. So maybe acceptable. The source is correct (GEO). Public IDs are correctly listed individually. Links are filled in the annotation, which wasn't in groundtruth. Since the groundtruth didn't have links, the annotation adding them isn't penalized but also doesn't gain points. The format in groundtruth was empty, annotation has "Processed Data". Not sure if that's accurate, but since groundtruth didn't specify, maybe it's okay. 

Similarly, data_3 in groundtruth is "genome sequencing", but in annotation, the split data entries (like data_6 is ENA, which was originally part of data_2 in groundtruth) might have different omics terms. Wait, looking at data_6: public_id PRJEB23709, which was in groundtruth's second data_2 entry. The groundtruth's omics there was "Transcriptome-level...", so the annotation kept that as "Transcriptomics", which is correct. The genome sequencing data_3 in groundtruth (dbGaP) is now data_7 in annotation, which has omics as "Transcriptomics" â€“ that's a problem! Wait, groundtruth data_3 is genome sequencing (so genomics?), but the annotation lists it as Transcriptomics. That's an error in accuracy. So that's a discrepancy. 

Wait, let me confirm. Groundtruth data_3:
{
    "id": "data_3",
    "omics": "genome sequencing",
    "link": "",
    "format": "",
    "source": "dbGaP",
    "public_id": "phs000452.v3.p1"
}

Annotation data_7:
{
    "id": "data_7",
    "omics": "Transcriptomics",
    "link": "...dbGaP...",
    "public_id": "phs000452.v3.p1",
    ...
}

So here, omics is wrong. That's a significant error. So that would deduct points. How many? The content accuracy is 50 points total. Each sub-object contributes to this. Let's see how many sub-objects there are. Groundtruth has 4 data entries (even though one is duplicated). But the annotation has 7 entries. But according to the content completeness, we have to check each groundtruth sub-object's presence and accuracy. 

For data_3 in groundtruth (genome sequencing), the corresponding in annotation is data_7, which incorrectly lists "Transcriptomics". That's a wrong omics type. So that's a major inaccuracy. That would be a deduction. Also, the other entries:

- The first three data entries (groundtruth data_1 split into 3) have correct public IDs and sources. The omics term is "Transcriptomics" vs "scRNA-seq". Since scRNA-seq is a type of transcriptomics, maybe acceptable. 

- The groundtruth's second data_2 (the one with ENA and PRJEB23709) is data_6 in annotation, which has omics as "Transcriptomics", which aligns with "Transcriptome-level gene expression data". So that's okay.

- The genome sequencing data (data_3 in groundtruth) is mislabeled as Transcriptomics. That's a critical error. So this would lose points here. 

Other possible inaccuracies:

- The links are added in the annotation where they weren't in groundtruth. Since the groundtruth didn't provide them, it's neutral. 

- Format field in groundtruth was empty, but annotation filled in "Processed Data". If that's accurate, then good. But if the groundtruth's data didn't specify, maybe it's okay. 

The main issue is the omics type for data_3. So for content accuracy, the genome sequencing entry (groundtruth data_3) is inaccurately labeled. So that's a deduction. Let's estimate how much. There are 4 groundtruth data entries (including the duplicated data_2). The omics error affects one of them, so maybe 50*(1/4)=12.5 points lost. But since the genome sequencing is a major mistake, maybe more like 20 points off? Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe each key-value pair's accuracy counts. For each sub-object, the omics field is crucial. So for each sub-object, if any key is wrong, it loses points. 

Alternatively, the content accuracy score for data is 50 points. The genome sequencing error is significant. Maybe deduct 10 points for that. Are there other inaccuracies?

Another check: In groundtruth data_2 (the first instance), public_ids are ["GSE78220", "GSE91061"]. The annotation's data_4 and 5 have those IDs correctly. So that's okay. 

The main error is the omics field for data_3/dbGaP. So maybe 10 points off, leading to 40/50. 

So data's total would be 10 +40 +40 =90? Or maybe more precise:

Structure: 10/10

Completeness:40/40

Accuracy: 40/50 (since one out of four entries had an omics error, which is 25% loss, 50*0.75=37.5, but maybe rounded)

Alternatively, if the genome sequencing entry is one of 7 in the annotation but only 4 in groundtruth, but considering the groundtruth's structure might have errors, but per instructions, we have to use groundtruth as reference. 

Wait, perhaps the groundtruth's data_3 is genome sequencing, but the annotation's data_7 says Transcriptomics. So that's a direct inaccuracy. So that's definitely a point deduction. 

Assuming the other data entries are mostly accurate except that one, maybe the accuracy is 40/50. So total data score 10+40+40=90. 

Now moving to analyses. Groundtruth has five analyses:

analysis_1: Single-cell cluster and diff expr analysis, uses data_1.

analysis_2: Functional enrichment, uses analysis_1.

analysis_3: Same name as analysis_1, but analysis_data is ["analysis_3"], which seems recursive? Possibly an error.

analysis_4: ICT outcome sig, uses data_2 and data_3.

The annotation has six analyses:

analysis_1: Single cell cluster, data_1, label ICT_outcome.

analysis_2: Differential analysis (diff expr?), data_1, cell clusters.

analysis_3: Pathway analysis, data_1, cell types.

analysis_4: Classification analysis, data_4 (which corresponds to GSE78220).

analysis_5: Validation with data_5,6,7 (original data_2 and 3's entries).

analysis_6: Comparison with data4-7.

First, structure: Each analysis in the annotation has the required keys. The groundtruth has analysis_data as an array, which the annotation follows. Some have additional "label" key, which isn't in the groundtruth's structure. Wait, the groundtruth's analysis objects don't have "label" but the annotation does. That's a structural difference. The groundtruth's analyses have id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The annotation adds "label". So that's a structure issue. Because the structure should match exactly the groundtruth's structure? Or the structure refers to the overall JSON structure?

The structure section says "structure should focus solely on verifying the correct JSON structure of each object and proper key-value pair structure in sub-objects." So the keys should match. The groundtruth's analyses don't have "label", but the annotation includes it. That's an extra key, which would mean structure is incorrect. So structure score might be reduced. 

Wait, the structure part is about the structure of the object, not the content. So if the groundtruth's analyses have keys id, analysis_name, analysis_data, but the annotation adds "label", that's an extra key. So that would violate the structure, unless the structure allows for additional keys. The problem says "proper key-value pair structure", so probably expecting only the keys present in groundtruth. Hence, the addition of "label" is a structure error. 

But the problem mentions "data_id or analysis_id are only unique identifiers..." so maybe the structure is about having the required keys. If the groundtruth doesn't have "label" but the annotation does, that's an extra key, which might count as a structure error. So maybe structure gets less than 10. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is about the presence of all necessary keys, not the absence of extra ones. The problem says "correct JSON structure of each object". If the groundtruth's analyses don't have "label", but the annotation does, that's an extra key which might not be allowed. So structure score would be penalized. Let's say structure is 8/10 because of the added "label" key in some analyses. 

Next, content completeness: The groundtruth has 5 analyses. The annotation has 6. Need to check if all groundtruth analyses are present. 

Groundtruth analysis_1: "Single-cell cluster and differential expression analysis", using data_1. The annotation's analysis_1 is "Single cell cluster", which is close enough semantically. The analysis_data is data_1. So this matches. 

Groundtruth analysis_2: "Functional enrichment analysis", using analysis_1. The annotation's analysis_2 is "Differential analysis" which might not be the same. Wait, the functional enrichment is different from differential analysis. So this might be missing. The annotation's analysis_3 is pathway analysis, which could relate to functional enrichment but not exactly. 

Groundtruth analysis_3: same name as analysis_1 but analysis_data is analysis_3 (recursive). Probably an error in groundtruth. The annotation doesn't have an analysis that's the same as this. So maybe not counted. 

Groundtruth analysis_4: "ICT outcome signature", uses data_2 and data_3. The annotation's analysis_4 is classification analysis with data_4 (which is part of data_2's split). Also, analysis_5 in annotation involves data_5,6,7 (data_2 and 3's entries). Analysis_6 compares multiple datasets. It's unclear if the ICT outcome signature is captured. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. The groundtruth's analyses may have some issues, like analysis_3's recursive dependency. The annotation's analyses may have different names but cover similar functions. 

The content completeness requires that all groundtruth sub-objects are present in the annotation. Let's map each groundtruth analysis:

1. analysis_1 (cluster + diff expr): annotation's analysis_1 and analysis_2 (differential?) might cover this. Maybe split into two analyses. So perhaps considered as present via analysis_1 and 2?

2. analysis_2 (functional enrichment): the annotation has pathway analysis (analysis_3) which might correspond. 

3. analysis_3 (duplicate name, possibly invalid): might be ignored as it's likely an error in groundtruth.

4. analysis_4 (ICT outcome signature): the annotation has analysis_4 (classification) and analysis_5 (validation) which might relate. 

Assuming that the functional enrichment (analysis_2 in groundtruth) is covered by analysis_3 (pathway analysis) in the annotation, and the ICT outcome is covered by analyses 4 and 5, then all groundtruth analyses are present except maybe the problematic analysis_3. Since analysis_3 in groundtruth is likely an error, it shouldn't be counted. So the groundtruth effectively has 4 valid analyses (excluding analysis_3). The annotation has 6, so they may have included extras but also covered the required ones. 

However, if the functional enrichment isn't properly captured, that's a problem. The annotation's analysis_2 is "Differential analysis", which might correspond to the differential expression part of analysis_1 in groundtruth. The functional enrichment (analysis_2) in groundtruth isn't directly present unless analysis_3 covers it. 

This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe the completeness score is 40 minus 10 for missing functional enrichment? Or maybe they did capture it through pathway analysis. 

Assuming the functional enrichment is addressed via pathway analysis, then completeness is okay. Then, the extra analyses (analysis_5 and 6) might be acceptable as they add more details. So completeness could be full 40. 

But the structure issue with the "label" key might deduct points from structure. 

Moving to content accuracy: For each matched analysis, check key-value pairs. The analysis_data references must correspond. For example, groundtruth analysis_1 uses data_1, and annotation analysis_1 uses data_1. That's correct. 

Groundtruth analysis_4 uses data_2 and data_3, which in the annotation are data_4,5,6,7. The annotation's analysis_4 uses data_4, and analysis_5 uses data_5,6,7. So together they cover the groundtruth's data_2 and 3. 

The analysis names might differ slightly but semantically align. Like "ICT outcome signature" vs "classification analysis". Maybe acceptable. 

The main issue is the structure with the "label" key. Also, the analysis_2 in groundtruth (functional enrichment) may not be accurately captured if the annotation's analysis_3 is pathway analysis instead. Whether that's equivalent depends on semantics. Pathway analysis could be a form of functional enrichment. 

Overall, the accuracy might be around 40/50, assuming some minor discrepancies but most correct. 

Putting it together for analyses:

Structure: 8/10 (for added label key)

Completeness: 40/40 (if all groundtruth analyses are covered)

Accuracy: 40/50 (some minor issues)

Total: 8+40+40=88. But maybe structure is lower. Alternatively, if structure is 10 because the keys are allowed to have more fields? The problem didn't specify that the annotation mustn't have extra keys. Wait, the structure section says "proper key-value pair structure". If the groundtruth doesn't have "label", but the annotation adds it, is that allowed? The instructions didn't say to exclude extra keys, just to have the correct structure. Maybe the structure is okay as long as required keys are present. The required keys are id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The extra "label" is additional but not part of the required structure. So maybe structure is full 10. 

Then structure is 10, completeness 40, accuracy 40 â†’ total 90?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-express:

If the structure score is 10 because the keys are correct (required keys are present), even with extra keys, then structure is fine. So structure:10/10. 

Completeness: The groundtruth's analyses (excluding analysis_3) are present in the annotation, so 40/40.

Accuracy: The ICT outcome analysis in groundtruth (analysis_4) is covered by analysis_4 and 5 in the annotation. The functional enrichment is handled via analysis_3. So accuracy is maybe 45/50. Maybe a few points off for the name differences. 

So analyses total could be 10+40+45=95? Or maybe lower. 

Lastly, results. Groundtruth has four results entries linked to analysis_1, each with features. The annotation's results have many more entries linked to various analyses, with metrics like AUC, sensitivity, etc., and features. 

Structure: Results in groundtruth have analysis_id, metrics (empty), value (empty), features. The annotation's results have filled metrics and values, and sometimes features are empty (like in analysis_1's results). The structure requires the keys to be present. The groundtruth's metrics and value are empty strings, but the annotation fills them. That's okay structurally. So structure:10/10.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has four results linked to analysis_1. The annotation has results for analyses 1-6. The groundtruth's results are all under analysis_1, so need to see if those four are present. 

Groundtruth's results for analysis_1 have features lists. The annotation's analysis_1 results have metrics like percentage change and features empty. The features in groundtruth are lists like ["SPP1", ...], but in annotation they're empty. That's a problem for completeness. 

The content completeness requires that all groundtruth sub-objects exist. The groundtruth has four results under analysis_1, each with features. The annotation's analysis_1 results have three entries (first three entries) with empty features. The features are missing, so those are incomplete. 

Thus, for content completeness: Each of the four groundtruth results must be present. The annotation has three under analysis_1 (maybe missing one?), but the features are empty. Since features are part of the sub-object, their absence means the sub-object is incomplete. So each missing feature list would deduct points. 

Alternatively, the completeness is about the existence of the sub-object. Even if features are empty, but the sub-object exists, it's counted. The groundtruth's results have features filled, so the annotation's empty features might be considered incomplete. 

This is tricky. The completeness is about having the sub-objects. If the sub-objects exist but lack required fields, that's an accuracy issue. 

The groundtruth's results have four entries for analysis_1. The annotation has three entries for analysis_1. That's one missing, so completeness is 3/4 â†’ 30 points. But maybe there's more. 

Alternatively, the groundtruth's four results for analysis_1 must be present in the annotation. The annotation has three, so missing one. Thus, completeness deducts 10 points (since 40 points total, missing 1 out of 4 â†’ 40*(3/4)=30). But maybe the features being empty is a content accuracy issue, not completeness. 

Completeness is about presence of sub-objects. So if the annotation has three results for analysis_1 instead of four, that's a completeness penalty of 10 points (since 40 total, losing 10 for missing one). 

Then content accuracy: For each existing sub-object, check key-values. The features in groundtruth are filled, but in the annotation they're empty. So for each of the three existing results, the features are missing, so that's a big deduction. 

Each of the three existing results would lose points for missing features. Since features are a key part of the content accuracy, this would significantly reduce the score. 

Additionally, the metrics and values in the annotation's results for analysis_1 are filled (e.g., "Percentage change", "15.1-fold...") whereas groundtruth's metrics and values were empty. Since the groundtruth didn't have those fields filled, does that matter? The problem says to evaluate based on the groundtruth's content. If the groundtruth's results have empty metrics and values, but the annotation filled them, that's not necessarily wrong, but if the groundtruth's required content wasn't there, maybe it's okay. Wait, noâ€”the content accuracy is about matching the groundtruth's information. Since the groundtruth's metrics and values were empty, the annotation providing them isn't incorrect but isn't scoring higher either. The main issue is the features being missing where groundtruth had them. 

Therefore, for content accuracy on the results: 

Each groundtruth result's features are key. The annotation's analysis_1 results have empty features lists where groundtruth had them. So each of the four groundtruth results would lose points for missing features. The annotation has three results for analysis_1, each missing features. Additionally, one result is missing entirely. 

This is quite severe. The content accuracy for results might be very low. 

Let me break it down:

Total content accuracy is 50 points. 

Each of the four groundtruth results' features must be present and accurate. The annotation's analysis_1 results have three entries with empty features. So for each of those three, the features are completely missing (accuracy lost). The fourth groundtruth result is missing in the annotation (another accuracy loss). 

Alternatively, the features are part of the key-value pairs. For each sub-object matched (the three present), their features are empty where they should have the list. So each of the three existing sub-objects lose points for features being wrong (empty vs filled). 

Since features are a major part of the results' content, this could deduct 30 points (each sub-object's features being wrong). Plus the missing sub-object deducts another 12.5 (assuming equal distribution). Total accuracy around 50 - 40 =10? That's too harsh. 

Alternatively, each sub-object's accuracy is evaluated. For each groundtruth result that's present:

- analysis_1's first result in groundtruth has features list. The annotation's first analysis_1 result has empty features. So that's a full deduction for that sub-object's accuracy. 

Same for the next two. The fourth groundtruth result is missing, so that's another deduction. 

If each sub-object's accuracy is worth (50/4)*something, but it's complex. Maybe the content accuracy is around 20/50. 

So results total could be:

Structure:10/10

Completeness:30/40 (missing one sub-object)

Accuracy:20/50 (features missing)

Total: 10+30+20=60. 

This seems plausible but might be too low. Alternatively, maybe the features are optional if the groundtruth didn't have them filled? No, the groundtruth's features are filled, so the annotation needs to match. 

Overall, the final scores would be:

Data: 90

Analyses: 90 (assuming structure ok, completeness ok, accuracy 40?)

Results:60

But I might have made some miscalculations. Need to verify again.

Final Scores:

Data: Structure 10, Completeness 40, Accuracy 40 â†’ 90

Analyses: Structure 10, Completeness 40, Accuracy 40 â†’ 80 (maybe accuracy lower?)

Wait, for analyses accuracy: if the functional enrichment wasn't properly captured, maybe accuracy is 35/50. 

Alternatively, maybe analyses accuracy is 45. 

This is quite involved. Based on my best estimates:

Final Scores:

Data: 90

Analyses: 90 (if structure is 10, completeness 40, accuracy 40)

Results: 60

But I might have missed nuances. For example, in results, the annotation has many more results for other analyses which might contribute positively, but the groundtruth's results are focused on analysis_1. The groundtruth's results are only for analysis_1, so the extra results for other analyses don't penalize completeness (since they're extra but not required). 

Therefore, the final scores:

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 90,
    "Analyses": 90,
    "Results": 60
}
</think>

{
    "Final Scores": {
        "Data": 90,
        "Analyses": 85,
        "Results": 60
    }
}

### Scoring Breakdown:

#### **Data**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  - Proper JSON structure with all required keys (`id`, `omics`, `link`, `format`, `source`, `public_id`).  

- **Content Completeness (40/40)**  
  - All groundtruth data sub-objects are represented in the annotation, even after resolving duplicates. Splitting multi-ID entries (e.g., `GSE120575`, `GSE115978`) into separate sub-objects is semantically valid.  

- **Content Accuracy (40/50)**  
  - Minor discrepancies:  
    1. **Genome Sequencing Error**: The groundtruthâ€™s `data_3` (genomic data) is mislabeled as `Transcriptomics` in the annotation (5-point deduction).  
    2. **Format/Link Fields**: While the groundtruth left these blank, the annotationâ€™s filled values ("Processed Data" and URLs) are contextually reasonable (no deduction).  
  - Overall, 10-point deduction for the genome sequencing mislabeling.  

---

#### **Analyses**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  - Proper JSON structure with all required keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`). Extra `label` fields do not penalize structure.  

- **Content Completeness (40/40)**  
  - All groundtruth analyses (excluding the flawed `analysis_3`) are semantically covered. New analyses (e.g., `analysis_5`, `analysis_6`) add depth without omitting core content.  

- **Content Accuracy (35/50)**  
  - Key discrepancies:  
    1. **Functional Enrichment**: Groundtruthâ€™s `analysis_2` ("Functional enrichment") is partially addressed via `analysis_3` ("Pathway analysis"), but naming mismatch reduces semantic alignment (5-point deduction).  
    2. **Recursive Analysis**: Groundtruthâ€™s `analysis_3` (invalid due to self-reference) is omitted, which is justified (no penalty).  
    3. **Analysis_4 Naming**: "ICT outcome signature" vs. "Classification analysis" retains semantic intent but lacks precision (5-point deduction).  
  - Total 15-point deduction for naming mismatches and incomplete coverage.  

---

#### **Results**
- **Structure (10/10)**  
  - Proper JSON structure with all required keys (`analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`).  

- **Content Completeness (30/40)**  
  - Three of four groundtruth results for `analysis_1` are present, but one is missing (10-point deduction).  

- **Content Accuracy (20/50)**  
  - Critical omissions:  
    1. **Features**: Groundtruthâ€™s `features` lists are entirely omitted in the annotationâ€™s `analysis_1` results (30-point deduction).  
    2. **Metrics/Values**: While filled values are added, they introduce new content not in the groundtruth (no penalty, but no bonus).  
  - Additional deductions for incomplete metric alignment and missing sub-objects.  

--- 

**Final Scores**:  
- **Data**: 90/100  
- **Analyses**: 85/100  
- **Results**: 60/100
