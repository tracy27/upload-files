Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

First, for the **Data** section:

The groundtruth has one data entry with specific keys like omics, link, etc., but some fields are empty. The annotation result lists nine data entries. 

Looking at structure: Each data sub-object in both has the required keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). Since all have these keys, structure is perfect. So full 10 points here.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has one sub-object. The annotation has nine. But we need to check if these nine correspond to the groundtruth's content. Wait, the groundtruth's first data entry uses "RNA-seq" as omics, while the annotation's first uses "Transcriptomics". Are these considered semantically equivalent? RNA-seq is a type of transcriptomics, so maybe. However, the groundtruth's data entry might represent raw sequencing data (fastq format), whereas the annotation includes various supplementary materials like CSV files and images. The groundtruth's data is more about the raw RNA-seq data, but the annotation includes processed data and other types like clinical biomarkers and histopathology. So there's an extra data objects in the annotation that aren't present in the groundtruth. Since the user mentioned that extra sub-objects may incur penalties depending on relevance, the annotation added 8 extra data entries beyond the single one in groundtruth. Each missing groundtruth sub-object would deduct points. Since the groundtruth only had one, but the annotation didn't capture that exact entry (since their first is Transcriptomics which may not be exact?), maybe they missed it. Wait, actually, looking closer, the groundtruth's data_1 is RNA-seq (a type of Transcriptomics), but the annotation's data_1 is "Transcriptomics" with a link. The omics field in the groundtruth was "RNA-seq", which is a subset of Transcriptomics. Maybe the annotator generalized it, so that could count as a match. But the other data entries in the annotation don't exist in groundtruth. Since groundtruth only has one, the annotation has 8 extras. However, the user says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties". Since the groundtruth only has one, but the annotation has nine, the content completeness for data would lose points because they added too many. But maybe some of them are valid but the groundtruth didn't list them? Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the groundtruth's data is incomplete, and the annotation expanded it. But according to the task, we need to use the groundtruth as reference. If the groundtruth only requires one data entry, but the annotation added others that aren't in groundtruth, then those are extra. So content completeness would penalize for adding extra? Or does it only deduct for missing?

Wait, the instructions say for content completeness: deduct points for missing any sub-object. So if the groundtruth has a sub-object that the annotation lacks, that's a deduction. But if the annotation has extras, those may also be penalized if they're not contextually relevant. Since the groundtruth's data is one RNA-seq entry, but the annotation's data_1 is Transcriptomics (which might be considered a match), but the rest (data_2 to data_9) are additional. The groundtruth didn't mention these, so they are extra. The question is whether those are relevant. The user says "depending on contextual relevance"—if those are part of the study's data beyond what groundtruth specified, maybe they are acceptable. But since the groundtruth is the reference, perhaps any extra is a penalty. Alternatively, maybe the groundtruth is simplified, and the annotation is more detailed. Since the task isn't clear on whether the groundtruth is exhaustive, but the instruction says "base on groundtruth as reference answer". Therefore, any extra beyond groundtruth's sub-objects should be penalized. 

So groundtruth has 1 data sub-object. Annotation has 9. Assuming that the first one (data_1 in annotation) is a match (since it's Transcriptomics vs RNA-seq), but the rest are extra. So the annotation has 8 extra, which might be penalized. However, maybe the groundtruth's data is just one example, and the actual article has more data, so the annotation's inclusion is correct. This is ambiguous, but per the user's instruction, the groundtruth is the reference, so we have to go strictly. Therefore, the annotation's extra sub-objects (8) would lead to a penalty. However, the problem says "sub-objects in annotation that are similar but not identical may qualify as matches". Since the first data entry's omics term is slightly different (Transcriptomics vs RNA-seq), but semantically related, so maybe it counts. Then the rest (8) are extra. The groundtruth requires 1, so the annotation has 1+8=9, but only the first is possibly a match, so the others are extra. Therefore, content completeness for data would be penalized for having extra entries. But how much?

The content completeness is 40 points total. The formula isn't specified, but likely, each missing sub-object (from groundtruth) reduces the points. Since groundtruth has 1, if the annotation captured it (with possible semantic match), then no deduction for missing. But since they added 8 extras, maybe that's a penalty. However, the instructions for content completeness say to deduct for missing sub-objects from groundtruth, and extra may also be penalized depending on relevance. So for data: 

If the first data entry in annotation is considered a match (despite omics term difference), then the content completeness is okay (no missing), but the extra 8 would each deduct points. How much? Not sure. Since the max is 40, maybe each extra sub-object beyond the groundtruth's count (1) would subtract points. Since there are 8 extra, that's 8*(40/1?) Not sure. Alternatively, the deduction is based on the number of missing versus extra. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches." So for content completeness, the key is whether all groundtruth's sub-objects are present in the annotation. If the first data entry is a match (even with slight variation in omics term), then no deduction for missing. However, the groundtruth's data entry has empty fields (like link, source), while the annotation's data entries have filled links and sources. But for completeness, it's about presence of sub-objects, not their content details. So completeness is about having the sub-object, not its key-value accuracy yet. 

Thus, for Data's content completeness: since the groundtruth has 1 data sub-object, and the annotation includes at least one that's semantically matching (the first), then completeness is 40 points. However, the extra 8 sub-objects may or may not be penalized. The instruction says "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." If those extras are relevant (as part of the article's data), maybe they are acceptable. But since the groundtruth doesn't mention them, perhaps they are considered irrelevant, leading to penalty. 

Alternatively, perhaps the groundtruth's data is just an example, and the article indeed has more data. Since the article's link is the same, the annotation's data entries might be accurate. In that case, the extra entries are correct and shouldn't be penalized. But since we have to take groundtruth as reference, which only lists one, maybe the extras are wrong. This is ambiguous. To resolve, perhaps the main data (RNA-seq) is captured in the first entry, so content completeness is full. The extra data entries could be considered correct if they belong to the article, so maybe no penalty. Thus, Data content completeness is 40.

Moving to content accuracy (50 points): For the data sub-object that matches (first one), check key-values. 

Groundtruth data_1:
omics: RNA-seq vs annotation's omics: Transcriptomics. Are these semantically aligned? RNA-seq is a method under transcriptomics. So acceptable. 

link: groundtruth is empty, annotation has a link. That's better, so no deduction. 

format: groundtruth has fastq vs annotation's FASTQ (case difference?), which is same. 

source: groundtruth empty, annotation filled. 

public_id: same as source. 

So the key-values for the matching sub-object are mostly accurate except omics term. Since the omics value is a superset, maybe acceptable. So accuracy here is good, maybe minor deduction for "Transcriptomics" instead of "RNA-seq". 

But the other data entries in the annotation (data_2 to data_9) are extra and their accuracy isn't considered here because content completeness already accounted for their existence. Since the accuracy score is for matched sub-objects, only the first is considered. So the data's accuracy would be full 50? Or maybe a small deduction for the omics term? 

If the omics field is crucial, maybe deduct 2 points (since RNA-seq is more precise). So accuracy: 48.

Total data score: 10(structure) +40(completeness)+48(accuracy)=98? But wait, the user said "separately score each object with max 100 each". Wait, the total for each object is up to 100 (structure 10, completeness 40, accuracy 50). So adding them: 10+40+50=100. So for data, if structure is 10, completeness 40, accuracy 48, total is 98. 

Hmm, but maybe the accuracy is 50 minus deductions. Let me recalculate. 

Accuracy for data: 50 points. The first sub-object's omics is slightly off (Transcriptomics vs RNA-seq). If that's a minor issue, maybe deduct 5 points (so 45). Other keys like link, format are better. So maybe accuracy is 45. Total data: 10+40+45=95. 

Alternatively, if the omics is considered a major key, maybe more deduction. I think it's better to deduct 5, making accuracy 45. 

Now moving to **Analyses**:

Groundtruth has six analyses (analysis_1 to analysis_6). The annotation has 13 analyses (analysis_0 to analysis_12).

Structure: Check if each sub-object has the required keys (id, analysis_name, analysis_data, and label if present). 

Looking at groundtruth's analyses:

Each has id, analysis_name, analysis_data. Some have label. 

Annotation's analyses:

They all have id, analysis_name, analysis_data. Some have label. So structure is okay. So 10 points for structure.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 6 analyses. Need to see if the annotation includes all 6, considering semantic matches. 

Groundtruth analyses:

analysis_1: RNA-seq (analysis_data: [data_1])

analysis_2: Diff exp between IMCD & HC

analysis_3: Diff exp between NMCD & HC

analysis_4: Diff exp between IMCD & NMCD

analysis_5: Functional enrichment (using analysis_4)

analysis_6: Diff exp among all three groups (IMCD, NMCD, HC)

The annotation's analyses include:

analysis_0: Read mapping (TopHat + HTSeq), data_1. This is a preprocessing step, not the initial RNA-seq analysis. Groundtruth's analysis_1 is called "RNA-seq", which might refer to the entire process, but the annotation splits it into analysis_0 (mapping) and analysis_1 (diff analysis). So maybe the groundtruth's analysis_1 is split here. Not sure if this counts as a match. 

analysis_1: Differential analysis (DESeq), data_4, group IMCD/NMCD/HC. This corresponds to groundtruth's analysis_6 (diff among all three), but groundtruth's analysis_6 is labeled as sample_type ["IMCD", "NMCD", "HC"]. The annotation's analysis_1 has label Group with those same three. So this is a match for groundtruth's analysis_6. 

analysis_2: PCA on data_4 (groups same). This is a new analysis not in groundtruth, so extra.

analysis_3: Pairwise correlation, also new. 

analysis_4: GO enrichment, matches groundtruth's analysis_5 (functional enrichment via GO). 

analysis_5: Pathway enrichment (KEGG?), which is another type of functional enrichment, so maybe counts as part of analysis_5 or separate. Groundtruth's analysis_5 is specifically "Functional enrichment analysis" with analysis_data from analysis_4. The annotation's analysis_4 and 5 are separate but related. 

analysis_6: Splicing analysis, new.

analysis_7-8: qRT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry validations, which are validation steps not in groundtruth.

analysis_9: Serum biomarkers (ELISA), new.

analysis_10: Colonic-specific DE analysis, similar to analysis_6 but focused on colonic samples.

analysis_11: Another PCR validation, same as analysis_7.

analysis_12: DEGs without medication, new.

So, trying to map groundtruth analyses to annotation:

Groundtruth analysis_1 (RNA-seq) is perhaps not directly present; the annotation's analysis_0 is read mapping, which is part of processing, so maybe not counted as the main analysis. 

Groundtruth analysis_2 (Diff exp IMCD vs HC) is analysis_2 in groundtruth. In the annotation, none directly match unless analysis_1 includes pairwise comparisons. Wait, the groundtruth's analysis_2,3,4 are pairwise diffs, while the annotation's analysis_1 is a multi-group diff (IMCD/NMCD/HC). So the annotation's analysis_1 covers analysis_6 of groundtruth. 

Groundtruth analysis_5 (functional enrichment on analysis_4) is covered by annotation's analysis_4 and 5. 

So the groundtruth has 6 analyses, but the annotation may have covered analysis_6 (via analysis_1), analysis_5 (via analysis_4/5), but what about the pairwise analyses (groundtruth's analysis_2,3,4)? The annotation doesn't have those explicitly. Instead, their analysis_1 combines all three groups. So those three (analysis_2,3,4 in groundtruth) are missing in the annotation. 

Thus, the annotation misses three analyses from the groundtruth (analysis_2,3,4), so content completeness would deduct for those missing. Each missing sub-object (out of 6) would reduce the completeness score. Since completeness is 40 points total, losing 3/6 means halving, so 20 points? But how exactly? 

Alternatively, each missing sub-object deducts (40/6)*number missing. So 40 - (40/6)*3 ≈ 40 - 20 = 20. 

But also, the annotation has extra analyses (like analysis_2 to analysis_12 excluding the ones that match), which might be penalized. The instructions say extra may be penalized depending on relevance. The extra ones like PCA, correlation, validation steps are part of the analysis workflow, so maybe they're acceptable. The user said "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance". If the extra analyses are relevant, they’re okay. But since the groundtruth only lists certain analyses, but the annotation adds more, maybe it's better to consider the extra as allowed, hence only deducting for missing. 

So content completeness for analyses: 

Missing three groundtruth analyses (analysis_2,3,4) → each missing is a deduction. Let’s say each missing sub-object (out of the total 6 in groundtruth) deducts (40/6)*points per missing. 40 - (40/6)*3 = 40 - 20 = 20. But that seems harsh. Alternatively, the completeness score is based on how many groundtruth sub-objects are present. If 3 are missing, then 3/6 = 50% missing → 20 points. So content completeness would be 20. 

However, maybe the pairwise analyses in groundtruth (analysis_2,3,4) are grouped into the multi-group analysis in the annotation (analysis_1). If that’s considered a semantic match, then they’re not missing. For example, if analysis_1 in annotation includes the pairwise comparisons implicitly, then they are covered. But looking at the analysis_data, the groundtruth's analysis_2 refers to analysis_1 (the RNA-seq), while the annotation's analysis_1 refers to data_4 (another dataset). It's unclear if they align. 

Alternatively, the groundtruth's analyses are more focused on differential expression between pairs, while the annotation's analysis_1 is a multi-group comparison. If that's considered a different analysis, then they are missing. Hence, the deduction stands. 

Assuming the deduction is 20 points for completeness. 

Then content accuracy: For the matched analyses (analysis_5 and 6 in groundtruth, mapped to analysis_4/5 and analysis_1 in annotation), check key-value pairs. 

For example, groundtruth analysis_5 is "Functional enrichment analysis" using analysis_4. The annotation's analysis_4 is "Functional enrichment analysis (GO)" using data_4. The analysis_data in groundtruth is analysis_4 (another analysis), while in the annotation it's data_4. That's a discrepancy. So this would affect accuracy. 

Similarly, analysis_1 in annotation uses data_4, which might not be the same as groundtruth's analysis_6 which uses analysis_1 (the initial RNA-seq analysis). So the data dependencies differ, which affects accuracy. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the accuracy is lower due to these mismatches. 

Alternatively, let's tackle each analysis:

Groundtruth analysis_1 (RNA-seq) – not found in annotation. 

Groundtruth analysis_2 (IMCD vs HC) – missing. 

analysis_3 (NMCD vs HC) – missing. 

analysis_4 (IMCD vs NMCD) – missing. 

analysis_5 (Functional enrichment from analysis_4) – partially matched with analysis_4 and 5 in annotation but with dependency issues. 

analysis_6 (all three groups) – matched with analysis_1 in annotation. 

So out of 6, only analysis_5 and 6 have partial matches. 

Accuracy for matched analyses (analysis_5 and 6):

For analysis_5 (groundtruth's analysis_5 mapped to annotation's analysis_4 and 5):

The analysis_data in groundtruth is analysis_4, but in the annotation's analysis_4, it's data_4. This is a critical mismatch because it changes the data source. So this would deduct significant points. 

Similarly, analysis_6's analysis_data in groundtruth is analysis_1 (RNA-seq), but in the annotation's analysis_1, it's data_4. Again, dependency mismatch. 

These inaccuracies in analysis_data would significantly impact accuracy. 

Given the complexity, maybe the analyses score is lower. 

Perhaps the content accuracy for analyses is around 30. 

Total analyses score: structure 10 + completeness (assuming 20) + accuracy (30) = 60. 

Proceeding to **Results**:

Groundtruth has 11 results entries (analysis_ids from analysis_2 to analysis_6, plus analysis_5 and 6). 

Annotation has 12 results entries (analysis_0 to analysis_12). 

Structure: Each result must have analysis_id, metrics, value, features. Checking the groundtruth and annotation. 

Groundtruth's results have all four keys. The annotation's results also have them, even if some values are strings or nested. So structure is okay (10 points). 

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 11 results. Need to see if all are present in the annotation. 

Groundtruth's results:

analysis_2: fold change, p-value, FDR for IMCD vs HC. 

analysis_3: same for NMCD vs HC. 

analysis_4: fold change, p-value, FDR for IMCD vs NMCD. 

analysis_5: functional enrichment terms. 

analysis_6: DEG features. 

Plus their p-values etc. 

Annotation's results:

analysis_0: metrics about alignment. Not in groundtruth. 

analysis_1: DEG features with FC, p, q. Corresponds to groundtruth's analysis_6's features? 

analysis_2: PCA result. 

analysis_3: correlation. 

analysis_4: GO terms (matches analysis_5). 

analysis_5: pathway terms (also part of functional enrichments). 

analysis_6: splicing (0 events). 

analysis_7: qRT-PCR metrics for features. 

analysis_8: IHC staining. 

analysis_9: biomarker analysis. 

analysis_10: colonic CXCL1. 

analysis_11: another PCR. 

analysis_12: common DEGs. 

The groundtruth's analysis_5 (functional enrichment) is covered by analysis_4 and 5 in the annotation. 

The analysis_6's features (the list of genes) in groundtruth are present in the annotation's analysis_1 and 12. 

However, the groundtruth's results for analysis_2,3,4 (the differential expression results) are not present in the annotation. The annotation's analysis_1 has DEG features but from a different analysis (analysis_1 in annotations corresponds to groundtruth's analysis_6). 

Therefore, the results for groundtruth's analysis_2,3,4 are missing in the annotation's results. Additionally, the groundtruth has specific metrics (fold change, p-values, etc.) for those analyses which are absent in the annotation. 

The annotation's results include extra entries (analysis_0,2,3,6-12) which may or may not be relevant. 

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 11 results. The annotation has 12, but several are missing (those tied to analysis_2,3,4). 

Specifically, the groundtruth has three analyses (2,3,4) each with three results (fold change, p-value, FDR). That's 3x3=9 results. Plus analysis_5 and 6, totaling 11. 

In the annotation, the results tied to analysis_2 (groundtruth's analysis_2) are missing. The annotation's analysis_1's results cover analysis_6's genes, but not the metrics for analysis_2,3,4. 

Thus, missing 9 results (from analysis_2,3,4's three each). Each missing sub-object (out of 11) would deduct. (40 points total). 

So 11 missing? No, groundtruth has 11, but the annotation may have some. 

Actually, the groundtruth's analysis_5 and 6 results are somewhat covered. So the missing results are those from analysis_2,3,4 (total 9). 

Thus, completeness score: 40 - (9/11)*40 ≈ 40 - 32.7 = ~7.3. That seems too low. Alternatively, each missing result deducts (40/11) per missing. 9 missing → 9*(40/11) ≈ 32.7 deducted → 7.3 left. 

That's very low, but maybe the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, the content completeness is about having the same sub-objects (i.e., same analysis_id entries). Groundtruth has 11 results with analysis_ids 2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,6. The annotation's results have analysis_ids 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So the analysis_ids from groundtruth's analysis_2 (ID 2) are present in the annotation's analysis_2? Wait, the annotation's results have analysis_2 as PCA (analysis_2 in annotation is PCA for analysis_data=data_4). The groundtruth's analysis_2 is a differential expression analysis. Their results for analysis_2 in groundtruth have metrics like fold change, p-values, etc., which are not present in the annotation's analysis_2 result (which is about principal components). 

Thus, the results for analysis_2 in groundtruth are entirely missing in the annotation. Same for analysis_3 and 4. 

So the number of groundtruth results: 

analysis_2: 3 results 

analysis_3: 3 

analysis_4: 3 

analysis_5: 1 

analysis_6: 1 

Total 11. 

The annotation has no results for analysis_2,3,4 (except analysis_4's result is about GO terms, which is analysis_5 in groundtruth). 

Thus, the missing results are 9 (analysis_2,3,4's 3 each). 

The annotation has results for analysis_5 (GO terms), analysis_6's features (in analysis_1 and 12), and others. So out of 11, only 2 are present (analysis_5 and analysis_6). 

So content completeness: (2/11)*40 ≈ 7.27 points. 

That's quite low. 

Content accuracy: For the existing results that match (analysis_5 and 6), check their key-values. 

Groundtruth's analysis_5's result has features like "immune response (GO:0006955)", which matches the annotation's analysis_4's value listing the same GO terms. So that's accurate. 

Analysis_6's features in groundtruth are a list of genes, which the annotation's analysis_1 and 12 include those genes (though with up/down labels). Since the features are the gene names, that's accurate. 

But the metrics in the annotation's analysis_1 are Fold change, P value, q value with thresholds, whereas groundtruth has exact numeric values. The metrics here are different (thresholds vs specific numbers), so that's a discrepancy. Similarly, the value in groundtruth is numerical arrays, while the annotation uses categories like ">2 or <0.5". This is a semantic difference. 

Thus, the accuracy for analysis_5 (GO terms) is good, but for analysis_6's DEGs, the metrics differ. So maybe accuracy is moderate. 

Overall, results' accuracy might be around 30. 

Total results score: 10 (structure) +7.27 (completeness) +30 (accuracy) ≈ 47.27, rounded to 47. 

But this is very rough. 

Putting it all together:

Data: 10 +40 (assuming completeness is full because they captured the main data) +45 (accuracy for omics term) → 95 

Analyses: 10 + 20 (completeness) +30 (accuracy) →60 

Results: 10 +7 +30 →47 

Final scores:

Data: 95 

Analyses: 60 

Results:47 

But I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe the data's content completeness is penalized for extra entries. If data completeness is 40 - (8 extra * (40/1))? Assuming each extra deducts (40/1)/9 (since groundtruth has 1, so 9 total), but not sure. This is getting too time-consuming. 

Alternatively, perhaps the scorer would give higher scores where possible. Maybe the data's completeness is full (40) since the main entry is there, and extras are allowed. Analyses: maybe they get 50 for accuracy if some are matched. Results: lower. 

Final estimates: 

Data: 95 

Analyses: 60 

Results: 47 

But need to present in the format.

### Scoring Breakdown:

#### **Data**  
- **Structure (10/10):** All sub-objects have the required keys (`id`, `omics`, `link`, `format`, `source`, `public_id`).  
- **Content Completeness (40/40):** The annotation includes at least one sub-object semantically matching the groundtruth (e.g., `data_1` in the annotation aligns with the groundtruth’s RNA-seq data via "Transcriptomics"). Extras are allowed if contextually relevant (e.g., supplementary materials).  
- **Content Accuracy (45/50):**  
  - The first sub-object matches the groundtruth’s core data (RNA-seq/Transcriptomics), but minor discrepancies exist (e.g., `omics` field uses "Transcriptomics" instead of "RNA-seq").  
  - Additional sub-objects (e.g., clinical biomarkers, histopathology) add valid context beyond the groundtruth’s simplified example.  

---

#### **Analyses**  
- **Structure (10/10):** All sub-objects include required keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`, and `label` when applicable).  
- **Content Completeness (20/40):**  
  - Missing three groundtruth analyses (pairwise differential expression comparisons between IMCD/HC, NMCD/HC, and IMCD/NMCD).  
  - Added analyses (e.g., PCA, validation steps) are contextually relevant but do not compensate for missing core comparisons.  
- **Content Accuracy (30/50):**  
  - Key mismatches include incorrect `analysis_data` dependencies (e.g., functional enrichment analysis references raw data instead of prior differential expression results).  
  - Some analyses (e.g., GO enrichment) align semantically, but dependencies and terminology differ slightly.  

---

#### **Results**  
- **Structure (10/10):** All sub-objects include required keys (`analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`).  
- **Content Completeness (7/40):**  
  - Groundtruth results for pairwise differential expression (analysis_2, 3, 4) are entirely absent in the annotation.  
  - Only functional enrichment (analysis_5) and DEG lists (analysis_6) are partially addressed.  
- **Content Accuracy (30/50):**  
  - Functional enrichment terms (e.g., GO terms) match well.  
  - DEG results omit quantitative metrics (e.g., fold changes, p-values) in favor of qualitative thresholds (e.g., ">2-fold change"), reducing precision.  

--- 

**Final Scores**:  
- **Data**: 95/100 (Structure + Completeness + Accuracy = 10 + 40 + 45).  
- **Analyses**: 60/100 (Structure + Completeness + Accuracy = 10 + 20 + 30).  
- **Results**: 47/100 (Structure + Completeness + Accuracy = 10 + 7 + 30).
