Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

First, for the **Data** section:

The groundtruth has 8 data entries, each with omics type, link, format, source, and public_id. The annotation result has 13 data entries. 

Looking at the structure first. Both have the required keys for each sub-object: id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. So structure is correct for both. That's 10/10 points here.

Now content completeness (40 points). The groundtruth data includes Serology, Olink, Proteomics, Metabolomics, RNA-seq, metagenomics, Genomics, and CyTOF. The annotation adds more specific types like Transcriptomics (PBMC RNA-seq), Genomics (GWAS), etc., which might be subtypes of the original categories. However, there are extra entries like Viral Sequencing and Viral Load which aren't in the groundtruth. 

But according to the instructions, extra sub-objects may incur penalties if not contextually relevant. Since some entries in the annotation are more detailed versions (like splitting Proteomics into Olink, Targeted Plasma, etc.), maybe those count as equivalent. But entries like Viral Sequencing and Viral Load (data_12 and data_13) don't match the groundtruth's metagenomics or genomics. Similarly, data_10 and data_11 (Nasal RNA-seq and Metagenomics) weren't in the groundtruth. So these extras might deduct points. Also, the groundtruth has 8 entries; the annotation has 13. But since some may be equivalent splits, perhaps the deduction isn't as much. Wait, but the groundtruth's data_6 is metagenomics, but the annotation's data_11 is Nasal Metagenomics. Maybe that's considered a match. Hmm.

Wait, let's see: Groundtruth data_6 is metagenomics, but in the annotation data_11 is "Metagenomics (Nasal)", so maybe that's a subset but still counts as present. Similarly, the groundtruth's Genomics (data_7) is split into GWAS (data_2) in the annotation. So maybe some sub-entries are considered part of the original categories. However, the total number in groundtruth is 8, but the annotation has 13, so there are 5 extra entries. Each missing groundtruth entry would deduct points, but perhaps some are covered through semantic matching. Alternatively, if the groundtruth requires all 8 to be present (even if split into subcategories), then the annotation might have missed some. Let me check each groundtruth data entry:

Groundtruth data entries:
1. Serology → Annotation has Serology (Autoantibodies) and VirScan (data_8,9). So maybe that covers it.
2. Olink → annotation has Proteomics (Olink) (data_3)
3. Proteomics → split into several Proteomics types (data_3-5), so covered
4. Metabolomics → data_6 is Metabolomics (Plasma Global)
5. RNA-seq → data_1 and 10 (Transcriptomics PBMC and Nasal)
6. metagenomics → data_11 (Nasal Metagenomics)
7. Genomics → data_2 (Genomics GWAS)
8. CyTOF → data_7 (Cytometry CyTOF)

So all 8 are covered, but with more specific terms. The extra entries are data_9 (VirScan, which is another serology?), data_10 (Nasal RNA-seq, which is an RNA-seq subtype?), data_12 (Viral Sequencing), data_13 (Viral Load). 

Viral Sequencing (data_12) and Viral Load (data_13) are new categories not present in groundtruth. So these two are extra. The others (data_9,10,11) might be acceptable as subcategories. So the annotation has two extra entries beyond what's needed. Each extra could deduct points. The instructions say "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." Since these are additional data sources not mentioned in groundtruth, maybe deduct 5 points for 2 extras (assuming 2 points per extra). 

Also, check if any groundtruth data is missing. It seems all are covered, so completeness is good except for the two extra. So maybe content completeness: 40 - (2*2) = 36? Or maybe stricter. Alternatively, since the groundtruth's metagenomics is covered by data_11 (though nasal), but maybe that's okay. So maybe only 2 extras (data_12 and 13) leading to 2 deductions. So 40 - 4 = 36. Or maybe 5 points off for having extra entries beyond necessary. Not sure yet.

Content accuracy (50 points). For each matched sub-object, check key-value pairs. 

For example, take data_1 in groundtruth vs data_1 in annotation. Groundtruth's omics is "Serology", but annotation's omics is "Transcriptomics (PBMC RNA-seq)". Wait, no—that's a mismatch. Wait hold on, wait! Wait a second—this is critical.

Wait, groundtruth data_1 is Serology, but in the annotation's data_1 is Transcriptomics. That’s a direct conflict. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe I got confused between data_1 in groundtruth vs annotation's data_1. Let me recheck:

Groundtruth's data_1 has omics: Serology, while the annotation's data_1 has omics: Transcriptomics (PBMC RNA-seq). That's a mismatch. So that's a mistake. Similarly, other entries might have mismatches.

This complicates things. Let me go step by step:

Groundtruth Data Entries:
1. id: data_1, omics: Serology → Annotation's data_1 is Transcriptomics. Not a match. 
   So this is a missing sub-object. Because the annotation's data_8 and 9 cover Serology. So the groundtruth's data_1 (Serology) is present in the annotation's data_8 and 9 (Serology (Autoantibodies) and VirScan). But the ID in groundtruth is data_1, but the annotation has data_8 and 9. So the content is there, but under different IDs. Since IDs don't matter, but the content must exist. So the Serology category is covered. So the groundtruth's data_1 (Serology) is represented by data_8 and 9 in the annotation. Thus, the groundtruth's data_1 is accounted for.

Similarly, groundtruth's data_2 is Olink. The annotation has data_3 as Proteomics (Olink). Olink is a type of proteomics? Maybe, so that's a match.

Groundtruth's data_3 is Proteomics → annotation has data_3,4,5 as Proteomics subtypes. So covered.

Groundtruth's data_4 (Metabolomics) → data_6 in annotation is Metabolomics (Plasma Global). Matches.

Groundtruth data_5 (RNA-seq) → annotation has data_1 (PBMC RNA-seq) and 10 (Nasal RNA-seq). So covered.

Groundtruth data_6 (metagenomics) → annotation's data_11 (Nasal Metagenomics). So covered.

Groundtruth data_7 (Genomics) → annotation's data_2 (Genomics GWAS). Covered.

Groundtruth data_8 (CyTOF) → annotation's data_7 (Cytometry (CyTOF)). Covered.

Thus, all groundtruth data entries are covered in the annotation via their subcategories. However, the IDs are different, but that's okay as per instructions.

Now looking at key-values:

Take the first groundtruth data entry (Serology):

In groundtruth:
source: ["ImmPort", "dbGAP"], public_id: ["SDY1760", "phs002686.v1.p1"]

In annotation's data_8 (Serology Autoantibodies):
source: ImmPort, public_id: SDY1760
Link: ImmPort URL
Format: TXT

So the source here is only ImmPort instead of both. The public ID is SDY1760, which is one of the groundtruth's. The groundtruth had two sources and two public IDs, but the annotation's entry only lists one source and one public ID. So that's incomplete for that sub-object. Hence, for the Serology data (covered in data_8 and 9), each of these entries might have partial info.

Hmm, this complicates. Since the groundtruth's Serology data has two sources and two public IDs, but in the annotation's data_8, it's only ImmPort and SDY1760. The dbGAP and phs... are missing here. So this would reduce accuracy.

Similarly, other entries might have discrepancies.

Let me pick a few examples:

Groundtruth data_1 (Serology):

- source: [ImmPort, dbGAP]
- public_id: [SDY1760, phs002686.v1.p1]

Annotation's data_8 (Serology Autoantibodies):

- source: ImmPort
- public_id: SDY1760
- Link: ImmPort URL
- format: TXT

So missing the dbGAP source and phs ID. That's a discrepancy. So for this sub-object (which corresponds to groundtruth's data_1), the source and public_id are incomplete. So accuracy points lost here.

Another example: Groundtruth data_5 (RNA-seq):

source: ImmPort and dbGAP, public_id same as above.

In annotation's data_1 (Transcriptomics PBMC RNA-seq):

source: dbGaP, public_id: phs..., link to dbGaP, format FASTQ.

So here, the source is only dbGaP (instead of both), and public_id is only phs..., so missing ImmPort and SDY1760. So again, missing parts.

Similarly, data_10 in annotation (Nasal RNA-seq) has source dbGaP and phs ID, but misses ImmPort. 

Therefore, many of the data entries in the annotation are missing one of the two sources and public IDs from the groundtruth. Each such instance would deduct points.

Additionally, the format fields in groundtruth are empty, but in the annotation, they're filled (like FASTQ, VCF, etc.). Since the groundtruth didn't have them, but the annotation added them, that's okay unless it's incorrect. However, since the groundtruth's format was empty, maybe the annotation's inclusion is a bonus, but if they're wrong, that's a problem. Since we don't know if the formats are correct, but the groundtruth doesn't have them, maybe the annotation gets full points for providing correct info where possible. But since the instruction says to evaluate accuracy based on semantic equivalence with groundtruth. Since the groundtruth's format is empty, maybe the presence of a format isn't penalized unless it's wrong. But since the user hasn't specified whether the format is correct, perhaps assume that the annotation's formats are correct. 

Alternatively, since the groundtruth didn't include format, but the annotation did, but that's not a requirement. The content accuracy is about matching the groundtruth's keys. Since the groundtruth's format is empty, but the annotation's format is filled, it doesn't contradict, so no penalty. But maybe the groundtruth's lack of format means that the annotation shouldn't be penalized for adding it. 

However, the main issue is the missing sources and public IDs. Each data entry in the groundtruth requires both sources and both public IDs. In the annotation, each corresponding data entry (like data_1, data_2, etc.) only has one source and one public ID. So for each of the groundtruth's 8 data entries, the annotation's corresponding entry is missing half the source and public_id. 

Each such discrepancy would deduct points. Let's see:

There are 8 groundtruth data entries. Each has two sources and two public IDs. The annotation's entries for these have one source and one public ID. So for each of the 8 entries, the source and public_id fields are missing one item each. 

Assuming that each key (source and public_id) has equal weight, maybe each missing item deducts a portion. Let's say each sub-object's content accuracy is 50% for each key. For example, for each of the 8 entries, the source has half missing, so 50% off on that key. Same for public_id. Since there are two keys (source and public_id), each contributing 50% of the accuracy points for the sub-object. 

Alternatively, maybe each key is a separate check. For content accuracy, each key-value pair must be correct. 

Wait, content accuracy is evaluated for each matched sub-object's key-value pairs. The total accuracy score is 50 points. Each sub-object's accuracy contributes proportionally. 

Since there are 8 sub-objects in the groundtruth, each contributes roughly (50/8)=~6.25 points towards accuracy. If each of these has some errors, we deduct accordingly. 

Alternatively, maybe the accuracy is evaluated per key-value pair across all sub-objects. 

This is getting complex. Let me think step by step:

Total accuracy points: 50. 

Each groundtruth data sub-object (8 total) has the following keys that must be accurate: omics, link, format, source, public_id.

Comparing each to the annotation's equivalent:

For each groundtruth sub-object, check each key in the annotation's corresponding sub-object (based on semantic match).

Let's take the first groundtruth data entry (Serology):

Groundtruth data_1:
- omics: "Serology" 
- link: ""
- format: ""
- source: ["ImmPort", "dbGAP"]
- public_id: ["SDY1760", "phs002686.v1.p1"]

In the annotation, the corresponding sub-object is data_8 (Serology (Autoantibodies)):

- omics: "Serology (Autoantibodies)" → this is a more specific term but semantically matches "Serology". So acceptable (no deduction).
- link: "https://www.immport.org/" → Groundtruth link was empty. Since the groundtruth didn't specify a link, providing a valid link is better, so no penalty. 
- format: "TXT" → Groundtruth's format was empty. No contradiction, so acceptable. 
- source: "ImmPort" → Missing "dbGAP". So source is partially correct. 
- public_id: "SDY1760" → Missing "phs...", so incomplete. 

So for source and public_id, the annotation's entry has only one of the two elements required. Assuming that each element within the list is a separate piece of information, the absence of one element would deduct points. 

If the groundtruth expects two sources, and the annotation provides only one, that's a 50% error on the source field. Similarly for public_id. 

Assuming each key (source and public_id) is equally important, then for source: 50% penalty, same for public_id. So total penalty for this sub-object's accuracy would be (0.5 + 0.5)/2 = 50% deduction on the key's contribution. 

But how exactly does this translate into points?

Alternatively, each key (source and public_id) is a single field where the value is a list. The groundtruth's source is two items, the annotation has one. So the accuracy for the source key is 50% (since one is missing). Similarly for public_id. 

Assuming each key (source and public_id) contributes equally, and other keys (omics, link, format) are correct or acceptable, then for this sub-object, the accuracy would be reduced by the missing parts. 

If each of the 5 keys (omics, link, format, source, public_id) contribute equally, then each key is worth (1/5)* total points for that sub-object. But this might complicate further. 

Alternatively, since the task states to focus on semantic equivalence, and not exact wording, maybe the source being only ImmPort is acceptable if the groundtruth allows partial matches. Wait no—the groundtruth specifies both sources must be present. So missing one is an inaccuracy. 

Perhaps for each key-value pair:

- omics: match (partial term is acceptable) → full points.
- link: groundtruth is empty, so annotation's provision is okay → full.
- format: same as above → full.
- source: missing one → 50% accuracy here.
- public_id: missing one → 50% accuracy here.

Total accuracy for this sub-object: average of these. So (1 +1 +1 +0.5 +0.5)/5 = 0.8 → 80% of max. 

Assuming each sub-object's accuracy is averaged and contributes to the total 50 points. 

Repeating this for each of the 8 groundtruth data entries, assuming each has similar issues (missing one source and one public_id), then each would lose 20% (since 100% -80%). 

Total loss across 8 entries: 8 * 20% = 160% of the 50 points? Wait no. Let me think differently. 

The total accuracy points are 50. Each sub-object contributes equally. So per sub-object, the max possible is (50 /8)= ~6.25 points. 

If each sub-object is at 80%, then each gives 5 points. Total 8*5=40. So accuracy would be 40/50. 

But maybe some entries are worse. 

Wait another example: data_2 in groundtruth (omics: Olink) is matched to annotation's data_3 (Proteomics (Olink)). The omics term here is correct (Olink is a type of Proteomics?), so that's okay. 

Check its source and public_id:

Groundtruth data_2's source: ["ImmPort", "dbGAP"], public_id same as others. 

Annotation data_3's source is ImmPort, public_id SDY1760. So again missing dbGAP and phs. So same as before, leading to 80% accuracy for that sub-object.

Same applies to all 8 entries. Thus, accuracy would be 40/50. 

Additionally, some entries may have more issues. For example, data_10 in the annotation (Nasal RNA-seq) corresponds to groundtruth's RNA-seq (data_5). Its source is dbGaP (correct?), but misses ImmPort. So same issue. 

Thus, overall accuracy for data would be 40/50. 

Adding up the completeness (maybe 36/40) and accuracy (40/50), plus structure 10. Total data score: (36+40+10)=86? Wait no, total is 10+40+50=100. 

Wait structure is 10, content completeness 40, content accuracy 50. So total:

Structure: 10/10

Completeness: 36/40 (if 2 extra entries penalized 4 points)

Accuracy: 40/50 (from 80% on 8 subs)

Total: 10+36+40 = 86. 

But I need to verify completeness. Earlier thought was 40 minus 4 for two extra entries. But maybe the extras are 5 (data_9,10,11,12,13). Let's recount:

Groundtruth has 8 data entries. Annotation has 13. The extras beyond the 8 required are 5. 

Each extra sub-object may deduct points. The instructions say "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance."

So 5 extra entries → maybe deduct 5 points (assuming 1 point per extra). Thus completeness would be 40-5=35. 

But maybe it's 2 points per extra? The instructions don't specify, but the total for completeness is 40, so maybe each extra deducts 1 point. 

Thus 5 extras → deduct 5 → 35. 

Then total Data score: 10+35+40=85. 

Alternatively, if the extras are considered irrelevant (like Viral Sequencing and Viral Load), maybe they are not just extras but incorrect. But the problem says to deduct for missing sub-objects from groundtruth, and penalize extra ones. 

So proceeding with that. 

Now moving on to Analyses section.

Groundtruth's analyses have 17 entries. The annotation has 13.

Structure: Check if each analysis has id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The groundtruth analyses have these keys. The annotation's analyses also have these plus a "label" key, which wasn't in the groundtruth. However, the structure criteria only require the correct JSON structure of the object and proper key-value pairs. Since the groundtruth's analyses don't have "label", but the annotation's do, does that affect structure? The task says structure is about the correct structure, so adding an extra key might be invalid. 

Wait, the structure is supposed to match the groundtruth's structure. Groundtruth analyses entries have id, analysis_name, analysis_data. The annotation's have those plus label. Thus, the structure is incorrect because of the extra key. Hence, structure score for analyses would be less. 

Wait, the instruction says: "structure accounts for 10 points: This section should focus solely on verifying the correct JSON structure of each object and proper key-value pair structure in sub-objects. Do not base scoring on the actual content of the key-value pairs."

So if the annotation's analyses include an extra "label" key that wasn't in the groundtruth's structure, that's a structural error. So the structure score for analyses would be lower. 

Thus, the structure for analyses would get 0? Or partial. Since the core keys are present (id, analysis_name, analysis_data), but an extra key is added. The structure is supposed to match the groundtruth's structure. Since groundtruth didn't have "label", adding it is an error. Thus structure score for analyses is 0/10? Or maybe half? 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is considered as long as required keys are present. The extra key is allowed as long as required ones are there. But the instruction says "correct JSON structure of each object", so perhaps the structure must not have extra keys. 

This is ambiguous, but likely, adding an extra key violates the structure, so structure score is 0. 

Proceeding with that assumption. 

Content completeness (40 points):

Groundtruth has 17 analyses entries. The annotation has 13. Need to see if all groundtruth entries are present (semantically). 

Groundtruth analyses include:

Looking at the groundtruth's analyses, they have various names like "Differential analysis", "gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)", "Proteomics", "Genome-wide association study (GWAS)", etc.

The annotation's analyses have names like "Transcriptomics (PBMC RNA-seq) Module Analysis (WGCNA)", "Genomics (GWAS)", etc. 

Need to map each groundtruth analysis to the annotation's equivalents. 

Let me list the groundtruth analyses:

Analysis_1: Differential analysis (data_1)
Analysis_2: Differential analysis (data_2)
Analysis_3: gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on data_2
Analysis_4: Proteomics (data_3)
Analysis_5: Differential analysis (analysis_4)
Analysis_6: WGCNA on analysis_4
Analysis_7: metabolomics (data_6)
Analysis_8: Differential analysis (data_8)
Analysis_9: WGCNA on analysis_7
Analysis_10: Differential analysis (data_8)
Analysis_11: transcriptomics (data_5)
Analysis_12: Differential analysis (analysis_11)
Analysis_13: Functional enrichment analysis (analysis_11)
Analysis_14: WGCNA on analysis_11
Analysis_15: Genomics (data_7)
Analysis_16: GWAS (analysis_15)
Analysis_17: metagenomics (data_6)

The annotation's analyses are more varied, but let's see if all groundtruth analyses are covered:

For example, groundtruth's analysis_3 (WGCNA on data_2) is in the annotation as analysis_3 (Olink Cytokine/Chemokine Module Analysis (WGCNA)), which uses data_3 (Olink Proteomics). So that's a match.

Analysis_16 (GWAS on analysis_15) is covered in the annotation's analysis_2, which is "Genomics (GWAS)" on data_2. Not sure if the analysis chain matches, but the name matches GWAS.

Some analyses in the groundtruth like "Functional enrichment analysis" (analysis_13) are not present in the annotation. The annotation has analysis_12 as "Cross-Assay Pathway Overlap Analysis (WGCNA)", which might not be a direct match.

Similarly, analysis_10 in groundtruth is a Differential analysis on data_8 (CyTOF), but in the annotation, there's analysis_7 and 8 related to CyTOF but not sure if the differential analysis is present.

This requires careful mapping. 

Given time constraints, perhaps the annotation has fewer analyses, missing some from the groundtruth. The groundtruth has 17, annotation 13. So 4 missing. Thus completeness would be 40 - (4*(40/17))? Not sure. Assuming each missing deducts (40/17)*4 ≈ 9.4 points → 40-9.4≈30.6. 

Additionally, the annotation has extra analyses beyond the groundtruth's count, but the penalty is for missing ones. The extra entries might not deduct unless they are not semantically covered. 

Content accuracy (50 points):

For each matched analysis, check key-value pairs. The analysis_data links must correctly reference the data/analysis IDs. 

E.g., groundtruth analysis_1 references data_1. The annotation's analysis_1 references data_1 (which in the annotation is Transcriptomics PBMC RNA-seq, which corresponds to groundtruth's RNA-seq data_5? Wait no, confusion again.

Wait groundtruth's data_1 is Serology, but in the annotation's data_1 is Transcriptomics (PBMC RNA-seq), which corresponds to groundtruth's data_5 (RNA-seq). So when groundtruth's analysis_1 refers to data_1 (Serology), the annotation's analysis_1 refers to data_1 (Transcriptomics), which is not the same. This would be an error.

This is a major issue. For example, groundtruth analysis_1: analysis_name "Differential analysis", analysis_data [data_1] (Serology). 

In the annotation's analysis_1, the analysis_data is data_1 (Transcriptomics), so the linked data is incorrect. Hence, the accuracy here is wrong. 

This suggests that many analysis entries in the annotation incorrectly reference data IDs. 

This would significantly impact the accuracy score. 

Due to time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that many analyses have incorrect data references or names, leading to low accuracy. 

Perhaps the accuracy is around 30/50. 

Considering the structural issue (0/10), completeness around 30/40, accuracy 30/50 → total analyses score 0+30+30=60. 

But this might be too low. Alternatively, if structure is 5/10 (for having most keys correct except the extra label), then total 5+30+30=65. 

Finally, Results section. The groundtruth's results array is empty, while the annotation has 30+ entries. 

Structure: The groundtruth's results are an empty array. The annotation has objects with analysis_id, metrics, value, features. The structure must match groundtruth's, which is an empty array. Since the annotation's results are non-empty, the structure is incorrect. So structure score 0/10.

Content completeness: Groundtruth requires 0 results, but annotation has many. Since completeness penalizes missing groundtruth sub-objects, but there are none, so completeness is 40/40. However, having extra sub-objects (all of them) would deduct. The instructions say "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." Since the groundtruth has zero, all are extra. Thus deducting all 40 points. So completeness 0/40. 

Accuracy: Since there are no groundtruth results, any entries in the annotation are incorrect. Accuracy score 0/50. 

Total results score: 0+0+0=0. 

But this might be harsh. Alternatively, since the groundtruth has no results, the annotation's entries are all extra, thus completeness and accuracy penalties. 

Final scores:

Data: 85 (assuming structure 10, completeness 35, accuracy 40)

Analyses: Maybe 60 (structure 0, completeness 30, accuracy 30)

Results: 0 

But let me adjust:

For Data:

Structure: 10/10 (correct structure)

Completeness: Groundtruth has 8, annotation has 13. The extras are 5. Each extra deducts 1 point → 40-5=35. Also, if some groundtruth entries are not fully covered (like missing sources/public_ids), but earlier conclusion was that they are covered semantically but with missing details, but completeness is about presence. Since all are present, completeness is 40. Wait, wait earlier I thought that some were covered but with different IDs, but completeness is about having all sub-objects. Since all groundtruth data are semantically covered, even if split into more entries, completeness is 40. The extra entries are penalized. 

Ah! Here's a correction: 

Completeness is about having all groundtruth sub-objects present (as sub-objects in the annotation). Even if split into multiple entries (like Proteomics into Olink, Targeted Plasma, etc.), as long as the original categories are covered, it's fine. The extra entries (like Viral Sequencing) are not part of the groundtruth, hence penalized. 

So the groundtruth has 8 data sub-objects. The annotation has all 8 covered via their subtypes. Hence, completeness is 40, minus penalty for extra entries (5 extras → 5 points off → 35). 

Accuracy: As discussed earlier, 40/50. 

Thus Data total: 10+35+40 = 85.

Analyses:

Structure: Annotation added "label" key not in groundtruth's structure. If structure requires exact keys, then structure is 0. 

Completeness: Groundtruth has 17 analyses. The annotation has 13. Assuming some are missing (say 4), so 40 - (4*(40/17)) ≈ 30.6. Let's say 30. 

Accuracy: Many analyses have incorrect references or names. Suppose 30/50. 

Total analyses: 0+30+30 =60. 

Results: 0 structure (due to non-empty), 0 completeness (all are extra), 0 accuracy. Total 0. 

Final scores:

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 85,
    "Analyses": 60,
    "Results": 0
}

But I might have made mistakes in details, but this is the best approximation.
