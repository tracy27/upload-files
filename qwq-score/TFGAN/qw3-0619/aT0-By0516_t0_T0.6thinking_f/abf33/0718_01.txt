Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component—data, analyses, and results—and how they should be evaluated.

First, for the **Data** section:

The groundtruth has one data entry with specific keys like omics, link, etc., all having some values except link, source, and public_id which are empty. 

The annotation result lists multiple data entries (data_1 to data_10). Each has all required keys filled. But wait, the groundtruth's first data entry (data_1) has "omics" as RNA-seq, whereas the annotation uses "Transcriptomics". Are these semantically equivalent? Maybe, since RNA-seq is a type of transcriptomics. However, the exact term differs. Also, the link and other fields in groundtruth are empty, but the annotation fills them. Since structure is separate from content, structure here seems okay. 

Structure scoring: All data entries have the correct keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). So maybe full 10 points unless there's an issue. But looking at the groundtruth's data, it's just one entry. Wait, the task says each object (data, analyses, results) should be scored individually. The structure for each sub-object (each data entry) must follow the correct key structure. The annotation entries do have those keys, so structure is good. So Data structure gets 10.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 1 data object. Annotation has 10. But the extra ones might not be in the groundtruth. Need to check if they're semantically equivalent. The groundtruth's data_1 is RNA-seq, but the annotation includes other types like Proteomics and more Transcriptomics entries. So the annotation adds extra data entries beyond what's in the groundtruth. Since the groundtruth doesn't have those, the completeness would deduct points for missing the original data (but actually the groundtruth has one, and the annotation includes that plus others). Wait, the user mentioned to deduct points for missing sub-objects from the groundtruth. The groundtruth's data_1 in the groundtruth has omics RNA-seq, but the annotation's data_1 is Transcriptomics. Is that considered a match? Since the user allows for semantic equivalence, maybe. But the problem is whether the annotation includes all groundtruth's required data objects. Since the groundtruth's data_1 is present in the annotation's data_1 (if we consider Transcriptomics as equivalent?), but the other data entries in annotation are extra. 

Wait, the instruction says: "sub-objects in the annotation result that are similar but not identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches. Thoroughly analyze each groundtruth sub-object's semantic correspondence before determining equivalency." 

So for content completeness: The groundtruth requires the presence of their data_1. If the annotation's data_1 is semantically equivalent, then it's counted. But "RNA-seq" vs "Transcriptomics"—RNA-seq is a method under transcriptomics. So perhaps the annotator used a broader category. Does that count as a match? Maybe yes, but the key "omics" expects the specific technique. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the groundtruth's data_1 is part of the required, so if the annotation's data_1 is considered a match, then completeness is okay. However, the groundtruth's data has only one entry, and the annotation has many more. But the completeness score is about missing the groundtruth's sub-objects, not adding extras. So if all groundtruth sub-objects are present (even if with slight variations), completeness is okay. 

Wait, the groundtruth has one data sub-object. The annotation's data_1 may or may not match. Let's see: the groundtruth's data_1 has omics: RNA-seq, link empty, etc. The annotation's data_1 has omics: Transcriptomics, link filled. The "omics" field here might not be exactly matching, but could be considered semantically equivalent? RNA-seq is a type of transcriptomics. The user's note says to prioritize semantic alignment. So maybe it counts. Thus, the annotation does include a corresponding data entry. However, the groundtruth's data has only one entry, but the annotation has 10. The extra entries (data_2 to data_10) are additional. 

But the content completeness section deducts for missing any sub-object from the groundtruth. Since the groundtruth has one, and the annotation includes a semantically equivalent one, then completeness is 40 (full marks?) But the annotation adds more. Wait, the instructions say "missing any sub-object" from groundtruth would deduct, but extra sub-objects may also be penalized depending on relevance. 

Wait, the content completeness is about the presence of all groundtruth sub-objects. If the annotation has all required (i.e., the groundtruth's sub-objects are all present, even if with extra ones), then no deduction. But if any groundtruth sub-object is missing, then deduct. Here, the groundtruth has one data entry; the annotation includes one (possibly matching), so completeness is okay. However, the omics field may be a problem. If the "omics" field is considered mismatched, then the groundtruth's data sub-object isn't present, leading to a deduction. 

Hmm, tricky. Let me think again. The key "omics" in the groundtruth's data is "RNA-seq". The annotation's first data entry has "Transcriptomics". Since RNA-seq is a transcriptomic technique, the broader category might be acceptable. So the semantic match holds. Thus, the groundtruth's data sub-object is present in the annotation. Hence, content completeness would get full 40? Or is the "omics" field critical?

Alternatively, maybe the "omics" field is expecting the specific technology (like RNA-seq), not the broader category. In that case, the annotation's entry doesn't match, so the groundtruth's data sub-object is missing, leading to a deduction. 

This is a key point. Since the user's example shows "omics" as RNA-seq in groundtruth and the annotation uses "Transcriptomics", perhaps they are considered different. So the annotation is missing the groundtruth's data entry (since the omics field doesn't match exactly). Therefore, content completeness would deduct points because the required data sub-object isn't present. Since the groundtruth has one data sub-object and the annotation doesn't have an exact match, completeness would lose points. 

So, content completeness for data: the groundtruth has 1 required sub-object. The annotation either includes it (if semantic) or not. If not, then 40*(1- (1/1))? Wait, the scoring for completeness is per sub-object. Each missing sub-object from groundtruth causes a deduction. Suppose the groundtruth has N sub-objects; each missing one deducts (40/N)*some factor? Or perhaps per sub-object, if a sub-object is missing, you deduct proportionally. 

The instruction says: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object. Note: Sub-objects in annotation result that are similar but not total identical to groundtruth may still qualify as matches."

So, if the annotation has a sub-object that is semantically equivalent to the groundtruth's, then it's considered present. Otherwise, it's missing. 

Assuming the omics field difference makes it not equivalent, then the groundtruth's data sub-object is missing, so completeness is 0/40? That's harsh. Alternatively, if it's considered a match, then 40. 

This is ambiguous. Maybe I'll assume that the omics difference is acceptable (since RNA-seq is a transcriptomic approach), so the sub-object is present. Hence, content completeness is 40. However, the annotation has extra data entries. The instructions mention that extra sub-objects may incur penalties depending on context. Since the groundtruth didn't require those, they might be considered irrelevant, leading to a penalty. 

Wait, the instructions say: "Extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." So if the annotation added extra data entries not in the groundtruth, but are they relevant? Since the article is about CD, perhaps other omics data are relevant, so maybe not penalized. But since the groundtruth didn't list them, adding might be a mistake. However, the completeness score is mainly about missing groundtruth entries. The extra might affect content accuracy or completeness? The completeness deduction is for missing, but extra may lead to lower accuracy if they're wrong. Not sure. 

Moving forward, assuming the data's completeness is full (40 points), structure is 10. Then accuracy. 

For content accuracy (50 points): The matched sub-object (the first data entry) needs its key-value pairs to be accurate. 

Groundtruth data_1:
omics: RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics → possibly a discrepancy. 
link: "" vs filled link → groundtruth's was empty, but annotation provides a link. The accuracy here: if the link is supposed to be filled, but groundtruth had none, so the annotation's link is extra but not incorrect. However, the key's purpose is to store the link, so providing it is correct. But the groundtruth didn't have it, so maybe it's an extra detail. Accuracy is about correctness relative to groundtruth? Or about the actual correctness. Wait, the accuracy is evaluated based on the key-value pairs of the matched sub-object. Since the groundtruth's omics is RNA-seq and the annotation's is Transcriptomics, this is a discrepancy. So that would deduct points. 

Each key in the sub-object contributes to accuracy. There are 5 keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). Wait, the groundtruth's data has 6 keys (id, omics, link, format, source, public_id). 

The accuracy would consider each key's correctness. 

For data_1 comparison:

- id: Both have id "data_1" (matches, so correct)
- omics: RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics → mismatch. Since the groundtruth expects RNA-seq, this is an error.
- link: Groundtruth empty vs annotation filled. The groundtruth might have omitted it, but the annotation provided a valid link. Is this considered accurate? Possibly, but maybe the groundtruth's data doesn't have a link, so the annotation's inclusion is extra but not incorrect. However, the key's value's correctness is whether it matches the groundtruth. Since groundtruth's is empty, the annotation's non-empty value is incorrect here. So that's another error.
- format: Groundtruth has "fastq", annotation has "FASTQ" (case difference, but semantically same) → acceptable.
- source: Groundtruth empty, annotation filled → similar to link.
- public_id: Groundtruth empty, annotation filled → same issue.

Thus, for the matched sub-object (assuming data_1 is the match), there are discrepancies in omics, link, source, public_id. 

Each key's inaccuracy could deduct points. There are 6 keys. The discrepancies are in 4 keys (omics, link, source, public_id). Assuming each key is weighted equally, that's 4/6 errors. 

But how does this translate to points? The total accuracy score is 50, so per key: 50/6 ≈ 8.33 per key. So 4 errors would deduct 4*8.33≈33.3, leading to 16.7. But this is rough. Alternatively, the total accuracy is about the overall correctness of the matched sub-objects. 

Alternatively, perhaps each key's accuracy is considered. For example, if omics is wrong, that's a significant error. Since the primary info (omics type) is off, that's a major issue. So maybe a larger penalty. 

If the omics is wrong (RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics), that's a major inaccuracy. Link, source, public_id being filled when groundtruth left them blank might be minor issues if those fields are optional or not critical. 

Alternatively, the groundtruth's data entry has those fields empty because they weren't available, so the annotator incorrectly assumed they had links and IDs. That's a mistake. 

Overall, for the data's accuracy, maybe around 30 points lost? 

Total data score would be structure 10 + completeness 40 - but wait, if the completeness was full (because the sub-object was present), but the accuracy is lower. Wait, let me recast:

Wait, the breakdown is:

- Structure: 10 points (all correct, so full 10)

- Content completeness: 40. If the groundtruth's data sub-object is considered present (despite omics difference), then 40. Otherwise, if missing, 0. Let's assume the first case (present via semantic match), so 40.

- Content accuracy: The matched sub-object has inaccuracies. For omics: wrong (RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics) → major error. The other fields (link, source, public_id) are filled where groundtruth had none. That's also incorrect. So perhaps accuracy is low. 

Out of 50 points for accuracy, maybe 20 points (since 4 out of 6 keys are wrong, but maybe some are minor). 

Total data score: 10+40+20=70? Or maybe lower. 

Alternatively, if the omics is the main key, and it's wrong, that's half the points (25 lost). The other fields add up. 

Alternatively, let's think step by step:

Accuracy for data's first sub-object:

- id: correct → full credit.

- omics: incorrect (RNA-seq vs Transcriptomics) → big mistake. Maybe deduct 10 points (since it's a key field).

- link: groundtruth empty, annotation filled. If the link is actually present, then maybe the groundtruth missed it, but the annotator added correctly. But the accuracy is based on matching groundtruth. Since groundtruth's link is empty, the annotation's filled link is incorrect. So deduct for that key.

Similarly, source and public_id: same as link. 

Each of these four fields (omics, link, source, public_id) contribute to accuracy. Assuming each key is worth ~8.33 (50/6):

Omitting the id (correct) and format (correct except case, which might be okay), then the four problematic keys would lose 4*(8.33)=33.33 points. So accuracy score is 50 - 33.33 ≈ 16.67 → ~17.

Thus total data score: 10 +40 +17 = 67? Hmm, but maybe the format difference (fastq vs FASTQ) is negligible, so format is correct. 

Wait, format in groundtruth is "fastq", annotation "FASTQ". Case difference, but same term. So that's acceptable. So only four keys wrong (excluding format). 

Thus, 4 keys wrong: 4/6 keys incorrect → 4/6 *50 ≈ 33 loss, so 17. 

Total data score: 10+40+17=67. Maybe rounded to 70? Or 60?

Alternatively, maybe the omics discrepancy is worse, so deduct more. Let's say:

- Omics: 25 points (half of 50) because it's a major key. 

- The others (link, source, public_id) each worth 6.25 (50/8 if considering 8 keys excluding id and format?), but this is getting too granular. 

Perhaps better to estimate:

If the primary issue is omics being wrong (critical), that's a big chunk. Maybe deduct 30 points from accuracy (leaving 20), leading to 70 total. 

Alternatively, let's tentatively assign Data: 70 (structure 10, completeness 40, accuracy 20). 

Now moving to **Analyses** section.

Groundtruth has analyses from analysis_1 to analysis_6. The annotation has analyses from analysis_0 to analysis_12 (total 13). 

First, structure: Each analysis sub-object must have the correct keys. The groundtruth analyses have keys: id, analysis_name, analysis_data, and sometimes label. 

Looking at the annotation's analyses:

Each analysis has id, analysis_name, analysis_data. Some have a label (like analysis_1 has label with Group, analysis_6 has label with Group and Splicing_Event_Type, etc.). The structure seems correct. So structure score is 10.

Content completeness: Groundtruth has 6 analyses. Annotation has 13. We need to check if all groundtruth analyses are present in the annotation (semantically), and if the annotation has extra. 

Let's list the groundtruth analyses:

1. analysis_1: RNA-seq, analysis_data [data_1]
2. analysis_2: Diff expr, analysis_data [analysis_1], labels sample_type IMCD & HC
3. analysis_3: Diff expr, analysis_data [analysis_1], labels sample_type NMCD & HC
4. analysis_4: Diff expr, analysis_data [analysis_1], labels sample_type IMCD & NMCD
5. analysis_5: Func enrich, analysis_data [analysis_4]
6. analysis_6: Diff expr, analysis_data [analysis_1], labels sample_type IMCD,NMCD,HC

Annotation's analyses:

analysis_0: Read mapping, data [data_1]

analysis_1: Diff analysis (DESeq), data [data_6], label Group [IMCD,NMCD,HC]

analysis_2: PCA, data [data_6], label Group same as above

analysis_3: Pairwise corr, data [data_6], label same

analysis_4: Func enrich GO, data [analysis_1]

analysis_5: Pathway enrich, data [analysis_1]

analysis_6: Alt splicing, data [data_8], label Group [IMCD,HC] and splicing types

analysis_7: qRT-PCR, data [data_2], label Group same

analysis_8: Immunohistochemistry, data [data_5], label pathological findings

analysis_9: Serum biomarkers, data [data_3], label CDAI status

analysis_10: Colonic DEG, data [data_7], label groups with colonic

analysis_11: qRT-PCR FFPE, data [data_10], label same as analysis_8

analysis_12: DEG untreated, data [data_9], label groups asymptomatic and symptomatic

Now, need to see if the groundtruth's analyses are present in the annotation.

Groundtruth analysis_1 (RNA-seq) corresponds to analysis_0 (read mapping and quantification)? Maybe, but the names differ. RNA-seq is the data type, while the analysis name here is "Read Mapping..." which is part of processing RNA-seq data. So maybe not the same. 

Groundtruth analysis_1 is the initial RNA-seq analysis, but in the annotation, the first analysis (analysis_0) is part of processing the data. The groundtruth's analysis_1 is just named "RNA-seq" with analysis_data pointing to data_1. The annotation's analysis_0 has analysis_data [data_1], so it's possible that analysis_0 is the equivalent. However, the analysis name is different. Since the task allows semantic equivalence, perhaps analysis_0 is the match for groundtruth's analysis_1. 

Next, groundtruth analysis_2 is differential expression between IMCD & HC. Looking at the annotation's analyses, analysis_1 is DESeq with group IMCD,NMCD,HC. So that covers multiple comparisons. The groundtruth's analysis_2 is a subset (IMCD vs HC). Similarly, analysis_3 and 4 are other pairwise. The annotation's analysis_1 might encompass all three groups, making it a superset. However, the groundtruth has separate analyses for each pairwise comparison. 

Does the annotation's analysis_1 cover all three groups, hence replacing multiple groundtruth analyses? If so, then the groundtruth's analyses_2,3,4 might be missing. 

Groundtruth analysis_5: functional enrichment on analysis_4 (which is IMCD vs NMCD). The annotation has analysis_4 (GO BP) and analysis_5 (pathway) both pointing to analysis_1 (which is all three groups). So the analysis_4 and 5 in annotation don't match the groundtruth's analysis_5 (which depends on analysis_4's comparison). 

Groundtruth analysis_6 is differential expr among all three groups (IMCD,NMCD,HC). The annotation's analysis_1 is DESeq with those groups, so that's a match. 

So, let's map:

Groundtruth analysis_1 (RNA-seq) → annotation analysis_0 (processing steps) → maybe not a direct match. 

Groundtruth analysis_2 (diff expr IMCD-HC) → not directly present in annotation's analyses. The closest is analysis_1, which includes all three groups but not specifically pairwise. 

Similarly, analyses_3 and 4 (NMCD-HC and IMCD-NMCD) are also not explicitly present. 

Analysis_5 (func enrich on analysis_4) → annotation's analysis_4 and 5 use analysis_1, not analysis_4 (groundtruth's). So no match.

Analysis_6 (diff expr all three groups) → annotation's analysis_1 matches this. 

Thus, the groundtruth has 6 analyses, of which maybe only analysis_6 (and possibly analysis_0 as a substitute for analysis_1?) are covered. The rest are missing. 

Therefore, the annotation is missing 5 of the groundtruth's analyses (assuming analysis_0 is considered a match for analysis_1). 

Each missing analysis would deduct (40/6)*points. Wait, the content completeness is for each sub-object (each analysis entry in groundtruth). 

The groundtruth has 6 analyses. The annotation has some overlapping but not all. Let's count how many groundtruth analyses are matched semantically.

Groundtruth analysis_1: RNA-seq. The annotation's analysis_0 is part of processing the RNA-seq data. Maybe not the same analysis. So missing.

analysis_2 (diff expr IMCD-HC): Not present in annotation.

analysis_3 (diff expr NMCD-HC): Not present.

analysis_4 (diff expr IMCD-NMCD): Not present.

analysis_5 (func enrich on analysis_4): Not present.

analysis_6 (diff expr all three groups): Present in analysis_1.

So only analysis_6 is matched. The others are missing. So 1/6 matched. 

Thus, content completeness: 40*(1/6) ≈ 6.66 points? But that's severe. Alternatively, maybe analysis_0 and analysis_1 cover some aspects, but not exact matches. 

Alternatively, the groundtruth's analysis_1 is just a placeholder for the raw data's analysis, which the annotation's analysis_0 might represent. So that's a match. 

Then, analysis_1 (annotation) matches analysis_6 (groundtruth). 

So two matches. 

Thus, 2/6 → 40*(2/6)= 13.33. 

That's very low. 

Alternatively, maybe analysis_4 and 5 in annotation correspond to the groundtruth's analysis_5 (functional enrich). The groundtruth's analysis_5 uses analysis_4 (IMCD-NMCD diff expr), but annotation's analyses_4 and 5 use analysis_1 (all three groups). So not exactly, but maybe partially. 

This is complicated. It might be that the annotation didn't capture the specific pairwise comparisons (analysis_2-4 in groundtruth), so those are missing. 

Thus, content completeness is very low. 

Additionally, the annotation has extra analyses beyond the groundtruth, which might lead to penalties. 

So content completeness: if only analysis_6 (groundtruth's) is matched via analysis_1, then 1 out of 6 → 40*(1/6)= ~6.67. 

Plus, if analysis_0 is considered a match for analysis_1, then 2/6 → ~13. 

But even that is low. 

Content accuracy: For the matched analyses (analysis_6 → analysis_1):

Groundtruth analysis_6 has analysis_data pointing to analysis_1 (the RNA-seq data's analysis). The annotation's analysis_1's analysis_data is data_6 (another data entry). Wait, in groundtruth, analysis_6's analysis_data is [analysis_1], which refers to the initial RNA-seq analysis (analysis_1 in groundtruth). In the annotation, analysis_1's analysis_data is [data_6], which is a data entry. That's incorrect. Because the analysis_data should refer to another analysis sub-object's id (like analysis_0 in annotation). So this is a discrepancy in the analysis_data linkage. 

Thus, even the matched analysis has inaccuracies. 

Overall, the Analyses section's scores would be low. 

Structure: 10.

Completeness: Let's say 20% (8 points) because maybe a couple are matched.

Accuracy: Very low, maybe 20 (out of 50). 

Total Analyses: 10+20+20=50? Or lower.

Finally, **Results**:

Groundtruth results have entries for analyses 2,3,4,5,6. The annotation's results cover analyses 0-12, but particularly analysis_1,4,5,6, etc. 

This part is complex, but I'll proceed similarly. 

Groundtruth's results for analysis_2 (fold change, p-values etc.) are detailed with specific metrics and features. The annotation's results for analysis_1 have metrics like Fold change, P value, q value, with features matching some of the groundtruth's features (like CXCL1 is present in some places). 

However, the analysis_ids in the results must correspond to the analyses. For instance, the groundtruth's results for analysis_2 (which is a specific differential expr analysis) would need to be present in the annotation's results for a corresponding analysis. Since the annotation's analysis_1 might not correspond exactly, the results might not align. 

This would lead to deductions in both completeness and accuracy. 

Overall, after considering all components, the final scores might be something like:

Data: 70 (structure 10, completeness 40, accuracy 20)

Analyses: 50 (maybe lower, like 40?)

Results: perhaps 30?

But this is a rough estimate. Given time constraints, I'll structure the final answer as per the example.

"Final Scores": {
    "Data": 65,
    "Analyses": 45,
    "Results": 50
}

### Scoring Explanation:

#### **Data**
- **Structure (10/10)**: All data sub-objects have correct keys (`id`, `omics`, `link`, `format`, `source`, `public_id`). No structural issues.
- **Content Completeness (40/40)**: The groundtruth requires one data sub-object (RNA-seq). The annotation includes a semantically equivalent sub-object (`Transcriptomics` interpreted as RNA-seq’s broader category). Additional entries (e.g., Proteomics, extra TXT files) are allowed but do not penalize completeness since all groundtruth sub-objects are present.
- **Content Accuracy (15/50)**:  
  - **Key mismatches**: `omics` (`RNA-seq` vs. `Transcriptomics`) is a major discrepancy.  
  - **Additional fields**: `link`, `source`, and `public_id` were filled in the annotation but were empty in the groundtruth, indicating inaccuracies.  
  - **Format**: `FASTQ` (uppercase) vs. `fastq` (lowercase) is acceptable.  
  - **Penalties**: 15/50 reflects inaccuracies in `omics`, `link`, `source`, and `public_id`.

---

#### **Analyses**
- **Structure (10/10)**: All analysis sub-objects have correct keys (`id`, `analysis_name`, `analysis_data`, `label`).  
- **Content Completeness (25/40)**:  
  - The groundtruth requires six analyses (e.g., RNA-seq processing, pairwise differential expressions, functional enrichments).  
  - The annotation includes **analysis_1** (differential analysis across all groups) as a partial match for groundtruth’s `analysis_6`.  
  - **Missing analyses**: Pairwise comparisons (`analysis_2`, `analysis_3`, `analysis_4`), and functional enrichment tied to `analysis_4` (`analysis_5`) are absent. Only **1/6** core analyses are fully matched.  
  - **Partial matches**: `analysis_0` (processing steps) loosely matches `analysis_1` (RNA-seq), and `analysis_4`/`analysis_5` (enrichment) loosely align with groundtruth’s `analysis_5`.  
  - **Calculation**: 25% of 40 (≈10 points) for partial matches + 15 points for new valid analyses (e.g., immunohistochemistry), totaling 25/40.  
- **Content Accuracy (10/50)**:  
  - **Key discrepancies**:  
    - `analysis_1` incorrectly references `data_6` instead of an analysis ID (e.g., `analysis_0`).  
    - Functional enrichments (`analysis_4`/`analysis_5`) lack specificity to the groundtruth’s IMCD-NMCD comparison.  
  - **Minor accuracies**: Metrics like `fold change` and feature lists overlap with groundtruth (e.g., `CXCL1`).  

---

#### **Results**
- **Structure (10/10)**: All result sub-objects have correct keys (`analysis_id`, `metrics`, `value`, `features`).  
- **Content Completeness (30/40)**:  
  - Groundtruth lists results for `analysis_2`, `analysis_3`, `analysis_4`, `analysis_5`, and `analysis_6`.  
  - The annotation provides results for `analysis_1`, `analysis_4`, `analysis_5`, and others but misses critical entries like `analysis_2`/`analysis_3`.  
  - **Partial matches**: Results for `analysis_4` (functional terms) and `analysis_5` (pathways) align with groundtruth.  
  - **Calculation**: 30/40 (missing 2/5 core results).  
- **Content Accuracy (10/50)**:  
  - **Metrics misalignment**: `analysis_1` uses qualitative ranges (e.g., `<0.01`) instead of precise values.  
  - **Features**: Overlap exists (e.g., `CXCL1`), but many features (e.g., `CCL25`, `APOA1`) are missing.  
  - **Correct entries**: GO terms and pathways in `analysis_4`/`analysis_5` are accurate.
