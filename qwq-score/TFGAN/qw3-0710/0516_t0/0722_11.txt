Okay, I need to score the provided annotation results against the groundtruth according to the given criteria. Let me start by understanding each component: Data, Analyses, and Results. Each has Structure, Content Completeness, and Content Accuracy scores.

First, let's tackle the **Data** section. The groundtruth has two data entries with omics types "Serum proteome data" and "Tissue transcriptome data". The annotation result lists "Proteomics" and "Transcriptomics". Those terms are more general but still semantically equivalent, so they match. 

Looking at Structure: Both have the correct JSON structure with id, omics, link, format, source, public_id. The keys are all present, so Structure gets full 10/10.

Content Completeness: Groundtruth has two sub-objects, and the annotation also has two. They correspond correctly, so no deductions here. Full 40/40.

Content Accuracy: The omics values are slightly generalized but still accurate. However, the source for data_1 in groundtruth is empty, but the annotation provides a specific source. Wait, actually, in the groundtruth, source is empty string, but the annotation filled it. Since the groundtruth might expect that information, maybe there's an issue? Hmm, but the task says to consider semantic equivalence. The presence of a source might not affect accuracy since the key exists. The key-value pairs for link and format are both "null", which matches the empty strings in groundtruth? Or does the format matter? The groundtruth uses empty strings vs "null" in annotation. But structurally, they are both present. So maybe this is okay. The public_id is also "null" vs empty, which is acceptable. So perhaps accuracy is full? Or deduct for the source? The problem is, if the groundtruth didn't have a source but the annotation added one, is that extra? The groundtruth's data_1's source is empty, so adding a source is incorrect. Wait, but the user said to deduct for missing sub-objects, not for extra info? Wait, the content completeness section mentions that extra sub-objects may incur penalties. Wait, in the data section, the number of sub-objects matches (both 2), so no penalty. The content accuracy part requires checking key-value pairs for accuracy. Since the source in groundtruth was empty, but the annotation added a source, that's an inaccuracy. Similarly, the public_id is "null" instead of empty, but maybe that's just formatting. Let me think again. The groundtruth's data_1 has source as empty string, but the annotation put in a real source. That's incorrect because the groundtruth didn't have that. So that's a mistake. Similarly, data_2's source is empty in both, so that's okay. So for data_1's source, that's an inaccuracy. So maybe deduct some points here. The other fields like omics are okay. The omics terms are close enough. So maybe deduct 5 points for the source error in data_1. So Content Accuracy would be 45/50? Or is the source considered part of the key-value pairs? The key exists, but the value is wrong. Since the groundtruth's source was empty, the annotation's addition is incorrect. So that's a discrepancy. So maybe deduct 5 points here. So total for Data: Structure 10, Completeness 40, Accuracy 45. Total 95? Wait, but maybe the source is not required? The groundtruth had it empty, so maybe the annotation shouldn't have added anything. But the user instructions say that for content accuracy, we check if the key-value pairs are semantically correct. Since the groundtruth's source was empty, providing a source is an error. Therefore, that's an inaccuracy. Similarly, the format and link being "null" instead of empty strings â€“ maybe that's acceptable since they're placeholders. So maybe 45/50. Alternatively, maybe the "null" is just a representation, so it's okay. Then maybe only the source is the issue. So 5 points off. Thus Data total 10+40+45=95. Wait, but the user says to deduct based on discrepancies. Let me note that.

Moving to **Analyses**: Groundtruth has four analyses: PCA, Spearman correlation, differential expression, ROC. The annotation has many more: Proteotranscriptomic, Case-control, Differential expression, Multivariate logistic regression, PSM, RCS, ROC, Nomogram. 

Structure: All the analysis objects in the annotation have the correct keys (id, analysis_name, analysis_data). Some have an extra "label" field, but the groundtruth doesn't include labels. However, the required keys are present. So structure is okay. So Structure 10/10.

Content Completeness: Groundtruth has 4 analyses; the annotation has 8. Need to check if the groundtruth's analyses are all present in the annotation. Let's see:

Groundtruth analysis_1: PCA analysis using data1 and data2. In the annotation, none of the analyses mention PCA. The first analysis is "Proteotranscriptomic analysis", which is different. So PCA is missing. 

Analysis_2 in groundtruth is Spearman correlation analysis, which matches with analysis_1 in the annotation? Wait, looking at the annotation's analyses: analysis_1 has "Proteotranscriptomic analysis". Analysis_2 is Case-control, analysis_3 is "Differential expression analysis" (matches groundtruth's analysis_3?), analysis_4 is Multivariate logistic, analysis_5 PSM, etc. 

Wait groundtruth's analysis_2 is Spearman correlation. Looking at the annotation's analyses, none explicitly name Spearman correlation except maybe the first analysis? No, the first is Proteotranscriptomic. The second analysis (case-control) doesn't mention Spearman. The results in the annotation do have Spearman in metrics, but the analysis name isn't. So the Spearman analysis is missing in the annotation's analyses. 

Similarly, groundtruth's analysis_3 is differential expression, which the annotation's analysis_3 is named similarly ("Differential expression analysis"), but let's check the analysis_data: groundtruth's analysis_3 uses data2 and data1, while the annotation's analysis_3 uses only data2. Also, the label in the annotation adds IgM levels, which the groundtruth didn't have. So maybe they are considered semantically equivalent? The name is the same, so maybe counts. 

The ROC analysis in groundtruth is called "ROC analysis", while the annotation has "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis" which is the full name but same thing. So that's present as analysis_7. 

So the groundtruth analyses (PCA, Spearman, Diff Exp, ROC) have: PCA is missing, Spearman is missing (the analysis name in annotation doesn't include it), Diff Exp is present (maybe), and ROC is present. So two missing analyses (PCA and Spearman). Each missing analysis would cost points. Since content completeness is per sub-object, each missing subtracts points. The total possible is 40 points (content completeness), with each analysis worth 10 points (since 4 groundtruth analyses). Wait, the content completeness is 40 points total for the object. The deduction is for each missing sub-object. Since there are 4 groundtruth sub-objects, each missing would deduct (40 /4 ) =10 per missing. So missing two, so 20 points off. But wait, the instruction says: "Deduct points for missing any sub-object." So maybe each missing sub-object deducts (40 / total_groundtruth_sub_objects). Here, groundtruth has 4, so each missing is 10 points. So two missing (PCA and Spearman) would be -20. However, the Diff Exp analysis in the annotation's analysis_3 might be considered equivalent. Let me recheck: groundtruth's analysis_3 is "differential expression analysis" and the annotation's analysis_3 has the same name. Even though the analysis_data differs (groundtruth used data2 and data1, annotation uses only data2), the name matches, so maybe it's considered equivalent. So maybe only PCA and Spearman are missing. That's two missing, so -20. 

Additionally, the annotation has extra analyses beyond the groundtruth. The user says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." Since the groundtruth didn't include those analyses, but the annotation added them, but the problem is whether they are relevant. Since the task is based on the groundtruth as the reference, any extra sub-objects beyond what's in the groundtruth may be penalized. How many extra? The groundtruth has 4, the annotation has 8. Subtracting the existing ones (assuming 2 missing and 2 present), so 8-2=6? Wait no, actually:

If the groundtruth has 4, and the annotation has 8, but 2 of the groundtruth's are present (Diff Exp and ROC), then the other 6 in the annotation are extras. But this might be too harsh. Alternatively, maybe some are valid but not in the groundtruth, so they are considered extra. The penalty for each extra is not clear, but the user says "depending on contextual relevance". Since the groundtruth is the reference, any extra sub-objects not present in the groundtruth could be seen as errors. So how many extra?

Let me count:

Groundtruth analyses names: PCA, Spearman, Diff Exp, ROC.

Annotation's analysis names: Proteotranscriptomic, Case-control, Diff Exp, Multivariate, PSM, RCS, ROC, Nomogram. 

Out of these, only Diff Exp and ROC are in the groundtruth. The others (Proteotranscriptomic, Case-control, etc.) are extra. So 6 extra analyses. Each might deduct points. If each extra is - (40/(number of groundtruth sub-objs))? Not sure. The instructions say "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." It's ambiguous, but maybe each extra is a 5-point deduction? Let's say each extra is -5, so 6*5=30. But that would lead to negative scores. Maybe better to consider that the maximum deduction for completeness is 40, so if we have 2 missing and 6 extra, but the main deduction is for missing ones. Perhaps the penalty is only for missing ones. The user might prioritize missing over extra. The example might not have that, but the instruction says to deduct for missing, and extra may also. So perhaps deduct for missing first, then see if the excess is too much. Alternatively, the extra might not be penalized unless they are wrong. Since the user wants to focus on the groundtruth, maybe only missing sub-objects are penalized. Let me proceed with that. So missing two analyses (PCA and Spearman), so -20. Thus, Content Completeness is 40-20=20. 

Wait, but the user says "extra sub-objects may also incur penalties depending on contextual relevance." So maybe each extra is a small deduction. Let's assume that each missing is -10, and each extra is -5. Total groundtruth has 4, so 40 points. If you have 8 in annotation, which includes 2 correct and 6 extra, plus 2 missing. The missing are -20 (2x10), and the extras add -6*5= -30. But that would go below zero. So perhaps only deduct for missing up to 40. Alternatively, maybe the extra sub-objects are allowed as long as they don't interfere with the existing. The user might not deduct for extras unless specified. Maybe I should focus on missing only. Let me stick with the initial thought: missing two analyses, so -20, thus Content Completeness is 20. 

Content Accuracy: Now, for the analyses that are present (Diff Exp and ROC). 

For analysis_3 (Diff Exp):

Groundtruth's analysis_3 has analysis_data ["data_2", "data_1"], while the annotation's analysis_3 uses ["data_2"]. That's a discrepancy, so deduct some points. Also, the label in the annotation has IgM levels, which wasn't in the groundtruth. Since the groundtruth didn't have a label, this extra info might be an inaccuracy. However, the key "label" is not part of the groundtruth's structure, but the structure is okay as long as required keys are there. 

The analysis name matches exactly (except capitalization?), but "differential expression analysis" vs "Differential expression analysis"â€”that's okay. The data used is incomplete (missing data_1), so that's an inaccuracy. 

For ROC analysis (groundtruth's analysis_4 vs annotation's analysis_7): The name is correct ("ROC analysis" vs "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis") which is semantically equivalent. The analysis_data in groundtruth is ["data_1"], and the annotation's analysis_7 also uses ["data_1"], so that's correct. The label in the annotation adds diagnosis groups, but groundtruth didn't have that. Since the groundtruth's analysis_data is correct, the accuracy here is okay. 

Other analyses present (like analysis_3 and analysis_7) have some issues, but maybe other aspects. Let's calculate:

Total accuracy points possible:50. 

For each matched sub-object (Diff Exp and ROC):

Each is worth (50/4) since there are 4 groundtruth analyses. Wait, maybe per sub-object's key-value pairs. Alternatively, for each of the existing analyses (the two that are present), check their key-value pairs.

For Diff Exp analysis (analysis_3):

- analysis_name: Correct (so +)
- analysis_data: Groundtruth uses both data1 and data2, annotation uses only data2. This is an error, so deduct.
- label: Groundtruth has no label, but the annotation added it. This is an extra key but not part of the groundtruth's expected structure. However, the structure allows additional keys? The structure section already accounted for the keys being present, so this might be okay. But for content accuracy, since the groundtruth's analysis didn't have a label, having one is incorrect. So that's an inaccuracy.

For ROC analysis (analysis_4 vs analysis_7):

- analysis_name: correct (semantically same)
- analysis_data: correct (data1)
- label: added in annotation but not in groundtruthâ€”another inaccuracy.

So each of these two analyses have inaccuracies. Let's say each analysis contributes to the accuracy score. Since there are two analyses present (out of 4 in groundtruth), each is worth 50/4 â‰ˆ12.5 points. 

For Diff Exp analysis: 

- analysis_data missing data1: -5 points?
- label added: -2.5 points?

Total for this sub-object: 12.5 -7.5=5?

ROC analysis:

- analysis_data is correct, so no deduction here.
- label added: -2.5 points?

Total for this sub-object:12.5 -2.5=10.

Total accuracy points from these two: 15. 

Additionally, the missing analyses (PCA and Spearman) aren't contributing, so the remaining two (the other two groundtruth analyses) contribute zero. 

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, the accuracy is evaluated per matched sub-object. The two analyses (Diff Exp and ROC) are matched. Each has some inaccuracies. 

Alternatively, for each key in the sub-object's key-value pairs:

Take Diff Exp analysis (groundtruth's analysis_3 vs annotation's analysis_3):

- analysis_name: correct â†’ + (no deduction)
- analysis_data: discrepancy â†’ deduct 5 (since it's missing data1)
- label: extra key â†’ deduct 2.5 (as it's an error)

Total deduction for this sub-object: 7.5

For ROC (analysis_4 vs analysis_7):

- analysis_name: correct â†’ +
- analysis_data: correct â†’ +
- label: extra key â†’ deduct 2.5

Total deduction: 2.5

Total deductions from accuracy: 7.5 +2.5=10. 

So total accuracy is 50-10=40? Or is it scaled per sub-object?

Alternatively, each sub-object's accuracy is 50/4 * (1 - deduction proportion). 

This is getting complicated. Maybe better to assign:

The Diff Exp analysis (analysis_3) has two issues: analysis_data missing data1 and added label. That's two inaccuracies. Each key's discrepancy might deduct points. For analysis_data, since it's part of the key-value, the incorrect data usage is a major issue. Maybe deduct 10 points for that. The label addition is minor, another 5. Total 15 points lost from 50? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the accuracy score is 50 points total for the object. For each key in each sub-object, if there's a discrepancy, deduct points. 

But given the complexity, perhaps:

Content Accuracy for Analyses: 

- Missing analyses (PCA and Spearman) are already accounted in completeness.
- The existing analyses (Diff Exp and ROC) have inaccuracies in data and labels. Let's estimate a 30% loss: 50*(0.7)=35? 

Alternatively, the Diff Exp analysis's data discrepancy is critical, so deduct 20, and the label adds another 10, totaling 30 lost, leaving 20. But this is guesswork. 

Perhaps a better approach is:

For each groundtruth analysis:

1. PCA (missing): no accuracy contribution.
2. Spearman (missing): no contribution.
3. Diff Exp (present):
   - analysis_data: incorrect (missing data1) â†’ -10
   - label added â†’ -5
   Total: -15
4. ROC (present):
   - analysis_data correct â†’ 0
   - label added â†’ -5
   Total: -5

Total deductions: 20 â†’ Accuracy score 50-20=30. 

Adding structure (10) + completeness (20) + accuracy (30) â†’ 60? 

Hmm, but that might be too low. Alternatively, maybe the label additions are not penalized because they're extra info, not part of the required keys. The structure allows extra keys as long as required ones are present. So maybe the label isn't a problem for accuracy. 

Re-evaluating: 

For Diff Exp analysis_3 in annotation:

- analysis_data is missing data1 â†’ that's a key inaccuracy. Since analysis_data is supposed to use both datasets, using only one is wrong. So maybe -10 points for that.

For ROC analysis_7:

- analysis_data is correct. Only the label is extra, but since the groundtruth didn't have it, it's an unnecessary addition, but maybe not a big deduction. Maybe -2 points.

Total deductions: 12 â†’ Accuracy 50-12=38. 

So total Analyses score: 10(structure) +20(completeness) +38(accuracy)=68. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's move on to **Results** next, then come back if needed.

**Results** section:

Groundtruth has three results. Let's look at each:

Result1: analysis_id analysis_2 (Spearman), metrics "correlation", features "IGHM", value [0.56, p<0.001]

Result2: analysis_3 (diff exp), metrics log2(fc), features IGHM, value [2.64, p<0.001]

Result3: analysis_4 (ROC), metrics auc, features [preEM, Continous igM, Ordinam IgM], values with ranges.

Annotation's results have nine entries. Let's see which ones align with groundtruth.

First, check each groundtruth result's presence in the annotation:

Result1 (Spearman analysis_2):

In the annotation, analysis_1 has metrics Spearman correlation and features IGHM with value 0.56. The analysis_id here is analysis_1 (Proteotranscriptomic analysis), but the groundtruth's analysis_2 is Spearman. The analysis_id mismatch suggests that the annotation's result is tied to a different analysis. However, the analysis_name in the result's analysis_id must correspond to the groundtruth's analysis_2 (Spearman). Since in the annotation, there is no analysis named Spearman, but analysis_1 has Proteotranscriptomic, which might include Spearman as a metric. The result in annotation's first entry (analysis_1) has Spearman as metric, features IGHM, value 0.56. So this seems to correspond to the groundtruth's first result, but linked to analysis_1 instead of analysis_2. Since the analysis_id is different, but the content (metric, features, value) match, maybe it's considered equivalent. Because the user said not to use IDs but content. So this is a match, even though the analysis_id is different. 

Result2 (analysis_3, diff exp):

Groundtruth's result2 is analysis_3 (diff exp), metrics log2(fc), features IGHM. In the annotation, analysis_1 has a result with log2(fc) and features IGHM (second result entry for analysis_1). So analysis_id is analysis_1 again, but the metrics and features match. So this is a match, even with wrong analysis_id. 

Result3 (ROC analysis_4):

Groundtruth's third result uses analysis_4 (ROC), metrics auc, features preEM etc., values with ranges. In the annotation, analysis_7 (ROC) has a result with metrics AUC and value 0.81 for features IgM. The features in the groundtruth were three items, but the annotation's features are ["IgM"], which is close but not exact. The value is 0.81 vs the groundtruth's [0.84...]. Also, the analysis_id is analysis_7 instead of analysis_4. But since the content (metric, features, value) should be checked. The metric (AUC) matches. Features are somewhat related (IgM vs preEM etc.), but not exact. The value discrepancy is significant. 

So the three groundtruth results may have partial matches in the annotation:

- Result1: matched via analysis_1's first result (correct metrics/features, but different analysis_id)
- Result2: matched via analysis_1's second result (same as above)
- Result3: partially matched with analysis_7's result (AUC, but features differ and value is off)

Now, evaluating Structure:

All results in the annotation have the required keys (analysis_id, metrics, features, value). So Structure 10/10.

Content Completeness:

Groundtruth has 3 results. The annotation has 9, but how many correspond to the groundtruth? 

- The first two groundtruth results are present (via analysis_1's entries).
- The third groundtruth result is partially present but not fully. 

Thus, two of the three groundtruth results are present. So two missing (third one is not fully there?), but maybe the third is considered missing. 

Wait, the third result in groundtruth has analysis_4 (ROC), but in the annotation, analysis_7 (ROC) has a result with AUC but different features and value. Since the features and values don't match, it's not a complete match. So the third groundtruth result is missing. 

Thus, two groundtruth results are missing? No, actually the first two are covered by analysis_1's results even with different analysis_ids, so they count. The third is missing. 

Therefore, one missing result. 

Total groundtruth sub-objects:3 â†’ each missing costs (40/3) â‰ˆ13.33. So one missing â†’ -13.33. 

Additionally, the annotation has extra results beyond the three. Each extra might deduct. There are 9-2=7 extra? But the third groundtruth's partial match isn't counted. So maybe 6 extras. But the user says to deduct for extra sub-objects if not contextually relevant. The extra results might be penalized. 

Assuming only the missing one is penalized (one missing: -13.33), the content completeness would be 40 -13.33â‰ˆ26.67. 

Content Accuracy:

For the two matched results (first two groundtruth):

Result1 (Spearman):

In groundtruth, the value is [0.56, p<0.001]. In the annotation's result1 (analysis_1), the value is "0.56" (only the first part). The p-value is missing. So that's an inaccuracy. 

Features are "IGHM" in both, so good. Metrics are "Spearman correlation" vs "correlation" (groundtruth's metrics was "correlation"). The annotation's metrics name is more specific but correct. So that's okay. 

The value missing p-value: deduct 5 points? 

Result2 (diff exp log2(fc)):

Groundtruth's value is [2.64, p<0.001]. The annotation's result has "2.64" as value, missing the p-value. So same issue. 

Features match. Metrics name "log2(foldchange)" vs "log2(foldchange)". Same. 

So each of these two results lose points for missing p-values. 

Third result (ROC):

Not properly matched, so no contribution. 

Total accuracy calculation:

Each of the two matched results have inaccuracies in the value (missing p-value). 

Each result's key-value pairs: 

For metrics, features, and value. 

For each result, if value is incomplete, that's a problem. 

Let's say each result is worth (50/3)*2 (since two are present). 

Each result's accuracy loss: 

Missing p-value in value: maybe deduct 5 points per result. 

Two results â†’ total deduction 10. 

Also, for the third groundtruth result, since it's missing, but accuracy only considers matched ones. 

Additionally, the third result in groundtruth had multiple features and specific values. The annotation's analysis_7 has features "IgM" instead of the listed ones. So even if partially present, it's not accurate. 

Wait, but that's part of the completeness (it was considered missing in completeness). 

So total accuracy deduction: 10 points. 

Thus, accuracy score: 50-10=40. 

Total Results score: Structure (10) + Completeness (~26.67 rounded to 27?) + Accuracy (40) â†’ total â‰ˆ77.67. Maybe round to 78. 

But let me recast:

Content Completeness for Results:

Groundtruth has 3 results. Annotation has 2 that match (first two), and the third is missing. So missing 1 â†’ deduction of 40*(1/3)= ~13.33. So 40 -13.33=26.67. 

Content Accuracy: 

For the two matched results (each worth 50/3 â‰ˆ16.67 points):

Each has value missing p-value. So per result, maybe deduct 5 points (total 10 deduction). 

Total accuracy: 50 -10=40. 

Total Results: 10+26.67+40=76.67 â†’ 77. 

Now compiling all scores:

Data: 95 (structure 10 + completeness 40 + accuracy 45)

Analyses: 10 (struct) +20 (comp) +38 (acc)=68

Results: 10 +27 (approx) +40=77

Wait, but earlier analysis's accuracy was estimated as 38? Let me recheck Analyses:

Earlier for Analyses:

Content Completeness: 40 -20 (for two missing analyses)=20

Accuracy: Let's say for the two present analyses (Diff Exp and ROC):

Diff Exp analysis_3:

- analysis_data missing data1 â†’ deduct 10 (since analysis_data is crucial)
- label added â†’ maybe deduct 5 (as extra info not in groundtruth)
Total deduction:15 

ROC analysis_7:

- label added â†’ deduct 5 

Total deductions:20 â†’ accuracy score 50-20=30 

Thus total Analyses: 10+20+30=60 

Wait that might be better. So:

Analyses:

Structure 10, Completeness 20 (because missed 2 out of 4), Accuracy 30 (deductions 20 from 50).

Total 60.

Then Results: 77. 

Final Scores:

Data: 95

Analyses:60 

Results:77 

Wait, but the Data's accuracy was 45? Earlier thought:

Data's omics terms were okay (Proteomics vs Serum proteome data â€“ equivalent). The source in data_1: groundtruth's source was empty, but annotation provided a source. That's an inaccuracy. So the source's key is present but value is incorrect (should be empty). So deduct 5 points from 50 â†’ accuracy 45. 

Yes, so Data total is 10+40+45=95.

So final scores:

"Final Scores": {

    "Data":95,

    "Analyses":60,

    "Results":77

}

But I need to make sure all steps are accurate. Let me double-check:

**Analyses Content Accuracy**:

For the Diff Exp analysis (groundtruth's analysis_3):

- analysis_data in groundtruth: ["data_2", "data_1"] (order doesn't matter, but both must be present). The annotation's analysis_3 uses only ["data_2"], so missing data_1. That's a major inaccuracy. So deduct 10 points.

- The label in the annotation's analysis_3 adds IgM levels, which wasn't in groundtruth. Since the groundtruth's analysis didn't have a label, this is an extra key. The presence of an extra key isn't a structure issue (structure allows extra keys?), but for content accuracy, since the groundtruth didn't include it, it's an inaccuracy. Maybe deduct 5.

Total for Diff Exp: 15 points off.

For ROC analysis (analysis_4 vs analysis_7):

- analysis_data correct (data1)

- label added, which groundtruth didn't have. Deduct 5.

Total deductions: 20 â†’ Accuracy 30.

Hence Analyses score: 60.

**Results Content Accuracy**:

First two results missing p-values:

Each result's value is missing the second element (p<0.001). The groundtruth's value is an array with two elements, while the annotation's have only one. So that's an inaccuracy. Each such inaccuracy would deduct 5 (total 10). 

Additionally, the third groundtruth result's features and values are not matched, but since it's considered missing in completeness, it doesn't contribute here. 

So Accuracy is 40 (50-10). 

Completeness for Results:

Groundtruth has three results. Two are present (with some inaccuracies), one missing. So deduction of (1/3)*40 â‰ˆ13.33 â†’ 26.67. 

Total Results: 10 +26.67 +40 =76.67, rounds to 77.

Thus, the final scores are as above.

    "Final Scores": {
